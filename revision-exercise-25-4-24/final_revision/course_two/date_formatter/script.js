Glucorex:
Glucorex is Embassy Pharmaceuticals and Chemical’s Natural 
Product indicated for the management of Diabetes mellitus. 

It contains the following products:
    1. Momordica charantia (Bitter melon)
    2. Cephalendra indica (Ivy gourd)
    3. Chionanthus virginica ( Fringe tree)
    4. Azadirachta indica (Neem)
    5. Ocimum sanctum (Holy Basil)
    6. Swertia chirayita (Chiretta)

    9. Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar Periwinkle)
    10. Cinnamomum zeylanicum ( Cinnamon)


Momordica charantia (Bitter melon):
The fruit contains at least three active substances with 
anti-diabetic properties, wc r Charanti, Vicine, and an 
insulin-like compound known as polypeptide-p. All dse
have been confirmed to have a blood glucose-lowering 
effect, 

Lectin reduces blood glucose concentrations by acting 
on peripheral tissues and suppressing appetite – similar 
to the effects of insulin in the brain

This is thought to be a major factor behind the 
hypoglycemic effect that develops after eating 
(Momordica charantia) bitter melon

These substances either work individually or together to 
help reduce blood sugar levels.


Cephalendra indica (Ivy gourd):
It has a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy 
as well as reduce blood sugar level.


Chionanthus virginica (Fringe tree):
It has a direct blood sugar lowering effect.

Azadirachta indica (Neem):
It exhibits islet (Beta cells) regeneration/protection 
properties and therefore have beneficial effects in 
diabetes mellitus

Ocimum sanctum (Holy Basil):
It helps protect against infection, lower blood sugar, 
lower cholesterol, ease joint pain, and protect stomach.


Swertia chirayita (Chiretta):
Chirata helps in weight loss as it increases metabolism 
and helps in burning more calories. 
It is also increases insulin secretion and reduces 
oxidative stress in diabetic patients due to its 
high antioxidant activity



Gymnema sylvestre (Australian Cow plant):
It reduces blood sugar levels by enhancing the level of 
insulin in the body. It promotes insulin response to 
food and lessens the need for insulin therapy and oral 
hypoglycaemic drugs. 

It block receptors in intestine hence lower sugar 
absorption thereby controlling postprandial blood 
sugar levels.



Syzygium jambolanum (Black plum):
It alleviates diabetic symptoms such as excessive 
urination or pushing.


Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar Periwinkle):
Vindoline is an alkaloid present in Catharanthus roseus.
It effectively ameliorated diabetes-induced hepatotoxicity 
(by docking oxidative stress), inflammation and 
hyper-triglyceridemia in type 2 diabetes

Cinnamomum zeylanicum (Cinnamon):
It could lower hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood 
sugar control over 3 months.
Cinnamon may help lower blood sugar and fight diabetes by 
imitating the effects of insulin and increasing the movement 
of sugar from the bloodstream into cells.

Dosage:
This medication is to be used by adults and is to be taken
1 tablet twice daily that one every 12 hours.
