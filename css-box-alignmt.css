CSS box alignment:
The CSS box alignment module specifies CSS features that relate 
to the alignment of boxes in the various CSS box layout models: 
block layout, table layout, flex layout, and grid layout. The 
module aims to create a consistent method of alignment across 
all of CSS. This document details the general concepts found 
in the specification.


Older alignment methods:
CSS traditionally had very limited alignment capabilities. We 
were able to align text using text-align, center blocks using 
auto margins, and in table or inline-block layouts using the 
vertical-align property. 


Basic examples:
The following examples demonstrate how some of the Box Alignment 
Properties are applied in Grid and Flexbox.

CSS grid layout alignment example:
In this example using grid layout, there is extra space in the 
grid container after laying out the fixed width tracks on the 
inline (main) axis. This space is distributed using justify-content. 
On the block (cross) axis the alignment of the items inside their 
grid areas is controlled with align-items. The first item overrides 
the align-items value set on the group by setting align-self to 
center.

.box {
    display: grid;
    width: 540px;
    grid-template-columns: 120px 120px 120px;
    align-items: start;
    justify-content: space-between;
}

.box :first-child {
    align-self: center;
}

<div class="box">
    <div>One</div>
    <div>Two</div>

    <div>Three
        <br>has
        <br>extra
        <br>text
    </div>
    
    <div>Four</div>
    <div>Five</div>
    <div>Six</div>
</div>






vertical-align
