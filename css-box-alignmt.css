/*
CSS box alignment:
The CSS box alignment module specifies CSS features that relate 
to the alignment of boxes in the various CSS box layout models: 
block layout, table layout, flex layout, and grid layout. The 
module aims to create a consistent method of alignment across 
all of CSS. This document details the general concepts found 
in the specification.


Older alignment methods:
CSS traditionally had very limited alignment capabilities. We 
were able to align text using text-align, center blocks using 
auto margins, and in table or inline-block layouts using the 
vertical-align property.
