<!-- 
ASK WHY?????????????????????????

Ths learnt:
1. Wn using flex to center a container, no need to give the 
parent container a width.

2. To center an item horizontally in a container:
- when main-axis is in horizontal direction i.e. flex-direction: 
row; use justify-content: center; 
- when main-axis in vertical i.e. flex-direction: column;
use align-items: center; 

These will centre the item(s) within the parent container.


3. If u think width: 100%; does nt work on a box/elemt, increase
it more than 100% and see the effect. Same for any other features.

width: 100%; 
It means d child elemt shd occupy d whole width of d parent elemt. 
It means be as big as the parent element i.e you want the child 
element to be as big as its parent but nt bigger than d parent.

The consequence is that if you have set margins and paddings on the 
parent element (and box-sizing is not set to border-box), the element 
will overflow, which is something you don’t necessarily want.

width: auto;
It means use the available space i.e margins and paddings will be 
respected, and the element will not overflow its parent.
The browser will calculate and select a width for the specified 
element.

Impt of width/height:
Width:
The width CSS property sets an element's width. By default, it sets 
the width of the content area, but if box-sizing is set to border-box, 
it sets the width of the border area.
width: px, rem, em, %, auto

The specified value of width applies to the content area so long as its 
value remains within the values defined by min-width and max-width.

If the value for width is less than the value for min-width, then 
min-width overrides width.

If the value for width is greater than the value for max-width, then 
max-width overrides width.


Height:
The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By default, 
the property defines the height of the content area. If box-sizing is 
set to border-box, however, it instead determines the height of the 
border area.
height: px, rem, em, %, auto

N.B: The min-height and max-height properties override height.

height: auto; 
The browser will calculate and select a height for the specified 
element.


4. U can use width ppty twice in a selector by using min/max-width 
and width.


5. A btn can have: 
background: transparent; 
and 
border: none;

The background shorthand CSS property sets all background style 
properties at once, such as: color, image, origin and size, or 
repeat method. Component properties not set in the background 
shorthand property value declaration are set to their default 
values.

transparent = not visible.


6. Impt of box-sizing:
The box-sizing CSS property sets how the "total" width and height 
of an element is calculated.

It applies to all elements that accept width or height.

.box {
    box-sizing: border-box;

    width: 100%;
    border: solid #5B6DCD 10px;
    padding: 5px;
}

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing    


7. In case you needed to use borders, use it for most impt containers.
8. Use ROYGBIV for your border colors.

9. Picture row(inline-direction) and column(block-direction) 
directions.

10. Learn to un(comment) out border(s).

11. Know more abt actual width by calculating width and padding.
N.B: Padding is a delicate th dt can affect width and height 
either +vely or -vely.

12. Understand perfectly your website structure (HTML layout).
How d elements r arranged and related.
How each division/section is placed.
How many components does each div/section has? 


13. min-width:
The min-width CSS property sets the minimum width of an element. 

It prevents the used value (actual value) of the width property 
from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-width.

The element's width is set to the value of min-width whenever 
min-width is larger than max-width or width.

E.g scenarios: 
a.
min-width: 75px;
This means actual width can be 75px and above and not lesser 
than 75px.

b.
width: 60%;
max-width: 350px;

In ds case, max-width: 350px; is applied.

c.
width: 60%;
min-width: 500px;

In ds case, width: 60%; is applied.

d.
width: 100%;
max-width: 350px;
min-width: 500px;

In ds case, min-width: 500px; is applied.


14. max-width:
The max-width CSS property sets the maximum width of an element. 

It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming 
larger than the value specified by max-width.

N.B: The max-width property overrides the width property, but 
min-width will always override max-width whether followed 
before or after width in your declaration. 

.wrapper {
    width: 100%;

    max-width: 20em; /* width will be AT MOST 20em wide */
}

.wrapper {
    min-width: 50em; /* Overrides max-width. width will be AT MOST 50em wide  */

    width: 100%;
    
    max-width: 20em; /* Will be AT MOST 20em wide */
}

min-width       >       max-width       >       width


E.g:
max-width: 700px;
This means width will be 700px and below and not higher than 
max-width specified.


Both min-min and max-width are in comparison with the actual 
width i.e.

body {
    width: 400px;

    min-width: 200px;
    
    max-width: 500px
}

So, both 200px and 500px are comparing individually with 400px.
That is, the width, 400px, can't be lower than 200px and the
width, 400px, can't be higher than 500px. 


15. Inline display
display: inline means: display d elemts side by side in a 
horizontal line.

The element generates one or more inline boxes that do not generate 
line breaks before or after themselves. In normal flow, the next 
element will be on the same line if there is space.


16. flex-wrap: nowrap/wrap/wrap-reverse;
The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one 
line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets 
the direction that lines are stacked.


17. box-shadow: none;
The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. 
You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described 
by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and 
color.

box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px red;
box-shadow: inset 5em 1em gold;

box-shadow: 0 0 5px 5px #8f0401;

The box-shadow property enables you to cast a drop shadow from the frame 
of almost any element. If a border-radius is specified on the element with 
a box shadow, the box shadow takes on the same rounded corners.

It can be used to increase the area and soften the edges of an elemt

Box-shadow generator is an interactive tool allowing you to generate a 
box-shadow.


18. white-space: pre-wrap;
The white-space CSS property sets how white space inside an element 
is handled.

White-space property specifies two things:
Whether and how white space is collapsed.
Whether and how lines wrap.

Note: To make words break within themselves, use overflow-wrap, 
word-break, or hyphens instead.

overflow-wrap
The overflow-wrap CSS property applies to text, setting whether the 
browser should insert line breaks within an otherwise unbreakable 
string to prevent text from overflowing its line box.

The property was originally a nonstandard and unprefixed Microsoft
extension called word-wrap, and was implemented by most browsers 
with the same name. It has since been renamed to overflow-wrap, 
with word-wrap being an alias.


19. opacity: 0.6;
The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the 
degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite 
of transparency.

0:	The element is fully transparent (that is, invisible).
1 (default value):	The element is fully opaque (visually solid/visible).


20. position: relative/absolute.
The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location 
of positioned elements.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position


Static:
This is d default positioning for HTML elements, where they follow the 
normal flow of the document based on the HTML structure.

The element is positioned according to the Normal Flow of the document. 
The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. 
This is the default value.


Relative:
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, 
and then offset relative to ITSELF based on the values of top, right, 
bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other 
elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is 
the same as if position were static.

The element is positioned relative to its original position.
Surrounding elements won't be affected, but there will be space
where the element would have been in the static (original) position.

This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index 
is not auto. 


Absolute:
The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space 
is created for the element in the page layout. The element is 
positioned relative to its closest POSTITIONED ANCESTOR (if any e.g 
a relatively positioned container) or to the initial containing block. 

Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, 
and left.

This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index 
is not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not 
collapse with other margins.


Fixed:
The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space 
is created for the element in the page layout. The element is 
positioned relative to its initial containing block, which is the 
VIEWPORT in the case of visual media. 
Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, 
bottom, and left.

Elements r positioned relative to the viewport and remain fixed 
even when the page is scrolled. There will be no space where 
the element would have been in the static position.


Sticky:
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the 
document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling 
ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), 
including table-related elements, based on the values of top, 
right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the 
position of any other elements.

This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a 
sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a 
"scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, 
auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest 
actually scrolling ancestor.

Elemts r positioned based on the user's scroll position. It 
behaves like a relative elemt until the user scrolls to a 
certain position, after wc it becomes fixed relative to its 
containing elemt or the viewport.


21. CSS is all about boxes all along.

22. line-height: The line-height CSS property sets the height 
of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between 
lines of text. 

The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box in 
horizontal writing modes. In vertical writing modes, it sets 
the width of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance 
between lines of text. 

The line-height property is specified as any one of the following:
    a <number>
    a <length>
    a <percentage>
    the keyword normal.

    
23. :focus
The :focus CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a 
form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered 
when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with 
the keyboard's Tab key.

Note: This pseudo-class applies only to the focused element 
itself. Use :focus-within if you want to select an element 
that contains a focused element.


24. visibility: visible/hidden/collapse;
The visibility CSS property shows or hides an element without 
changing the layout of a document. The property can also hide 
rows or columns in a <table>.

To both hide an element and remove it from the document layout, 
set the display property to none instead of using visibility.


25. img, span, links r e.gs of inline elemets. 
Inline elemts do nt have both height and width properties.

inline-block elemt has both the inline and block display ppties. 
It has both height and width properties.

inline-flex: is similar to display: flex; but the container on 
wc display: inline-flex; is applied behaves like an inline elemt.

grid: by having grid layouts, you av precise ctrl over both rows 
and columns.

inline-grid: is similar to display: grid; but the container on wc 
display: inline-grid; is applied behaves like an inline elemt.

display: none; 
d elemt will be completely invisible and take up no space within
 d documt.

display:inherit; 
d child elemt with d display inherit will inherit the display value 
from its parent elemt(eg. div) and act as a block-level elemt.

display: initial; 
sets d display ppty of an elemt to its initial value, wc is usu 
inline for most elemts.


26. media(min/max-width: px) {} for responsiveness.

27. ul/ol has an invisible default margin top and bottom of 16px.
28. ul/ol has an invisible default left padding of 40px.

29. Grp more than 2 selectors together if dy have common ppties.


30. block/column axis:
CSS grid layout is a two-dimensional layout method enabling the 
laying out of content in rows and columns. Therefore in any grid 
we have two axes. The block or column axis, and the inline or 
row axis.


31. The cross axis:
The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis. Therefore, if your 
flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis 
runs down the columns.
If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs 
along the rows.


32. The main axis
The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:
row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse

Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along the row 
in the inline direction.

If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the main axis runs 
perpendicularly/downward.


align-content/-items/-self:

33. align-content: start/end/center/space-btw/space-ard
The CSS align-content property sets the distribution of space 
between and around content items along a flexbox's CROSS axis, 
or a grid or block-level element's BLOCK axis of a container. 

It affects space in a container around the content items.

This property has no effect on single line flex containers 
(i.e. ones with flex-wrap: nowrap) but does affect flex
containers with flex-direction: column.


34. align-items: stretch/start/end/center. 
The default value is stretch. The CSS align-items property sets 
the align-self value on all DIRECT children as a group. 

In flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the cross
axis. 

In grid layout, it controls the alignment of items on the block 
axis within their grid areas.


35. align-self: stretch/start/end/center. 
The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's 
align-items value common to all d children elements and affect 
only d specified child elemt.

In flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.

In grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. 


justify-content/-items/-self:

36. justify-content: start/center/space-between/-around/-evenly.
The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes 
SPACE between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex 
container, and the inline axis of a grid container. 
It deals with d parent container.


37. justify-items: stretch/center/start/end
The CSS justify-items property defines the default JUSTIFY-SELF for 
all items of the box, giving them all a default way of justifying 
each box along the appropriate axis.

The effect of this property is dependent of the layout mode we 
are in: 
In block-level layouts, it aligns the items inside their 
individual containing block on the inline axis.

In flexbox layouts, this property is ignored.

In grid layouts, it aligns the items inside their grid areas on 
the inline axis 


38. justify-self: stretch/start/end/center
It deals with a single child elemt. The CSS justify-self property 
sets the way a box or an item is justified inside its alignment 
container along the appropriate axis.


39. row-gap:
The row-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between 
an element's rows. Rows r in horizontal directions. 

Rows egs:
======================= row
row-gap
======================= row
row-gap
======================= row
row-gap
======================= row


40. column-gap
The column-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between 
an element's columns. Columns r in vertical directions.

Initially a part of Multi-column Layout, the definition of column-gap 
has been broadened to include multiple layout methods. Now specified 
in CSS box alignment, it may be used in multi-column, flexible box, 
and grid layouts.

column egs:

column               column              column              column
####    column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####
####    column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####
####    column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####
####    column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####


41. display
The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a 
block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as 
flow layout, grid or flex.

Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer 
display types. The outer type sets an element's participation in 
flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children.

display: inline/inline-block/flex/grid


42. inner and outer display:
<display-outside>
These keywords specify the element's outer display type, which 
is essentially its role in flow layout i.e. participation in 
flow layout:

1. block:
The element generates a block box, generating line breaks both 
before and after the element when in the normal flow.

2. inline:
The element generates one or more inline boxes that do not 
generate line breaks before or after themselves. In normal 
flow, the next element will be on the same line if there 
is space.


43. <display-inside>
These keywords specify the element's inner display type, which 
defines the type of formatting context that its contents are 
laid out in (assuming it is a non-replaced element). It sets 
the layout of children wc can be for instance flex, grid etc.


44. fill:
The fill attribute has two different meanings (color and final 
state of animation). For shapes and text it's a presentation 
attribute that defines the color (or any SVG paint servers like 
gradients or patterns) used to paint the element; for animation 
it defines the final state of the animation.


45. border:
The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It 
sets the values of border-width, border-style, and border-color.

The border property may be specified using one, two, or three 
of the values listed above. The order of the values does not 
matter.


46. outline:
The outline CSS shorthand property sets most of the outline 
properties in a single declaration.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
outline-width, outline-style, outline-color.

The outline property may be specified using one, two, or three 
of the values listed above. The order of the values does not 
matter. As with all shorthand properties, any omitted sub-values 
will be set to their initial values.


47. padding and margin:
The padding CSS shorthand property sets the padding area on all 
four sides of an element at once. 

An element's padding area is the space between its content and 
its border.

The margin CSS shorthand property sets the margin area on all 
four sides of an element.
The margin area, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border 
area to include an empty area used to separate the element from 
its neighbors. 

Its dimensions are the margin box width and the margin box height.

Note: Padding creates extra space within an element. In contrast, 
margin creates extra space around an element.


48. z-index
The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element 
and its descendants or flex and grid items. 

Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a 
smaller one.

For a positioned box (that is, one with any position other than 
static), the z-index property specifies:
- The stack level of the box in the current stacking context.
- Whether the box establishes a local stacking context.

The z-index property is specified as either the keyword auto or 
an <integer>.

z-index: auto;
The box does not establish a new local stacking context. The stack 
level of the generated box in the current stacking context is 0.


49. :not()
The :not() CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match 
a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items from being 
selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.

The :not() pseudo-class requires a selector list, a comma-separated 
list of one or more selectors, as its argument. The list must not 
contain another negation selector or a pseudo-element, but any other 
simple, compound, and complex selectors are allowed.

.playlist li:not(:last-child) {
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--background-color);
}


50. buttons:
button styles: 
the background color, text color, the border style, the size.

button states: hover, focus, active.


51. CSS scrollbars styling
The CSS scrollbars styling module defines properties that you 
can use for visual styling of scrollbars. You can customize the 
width of the scrollbar as required. 

You can also customize the color of the scrollbar track, which 
is the background of the scrollbar, and the color of the scrollbar 
thumb, which is the draggable handle of the scrollbar.

.poem {
    overflow: scroll;
    scrollbar-width: thin;
    scrollbar-color: red orange;
}

Note: When customizing scrollbars, ensure that the thumb and 
track have enough contrast with the surrounding background. 
Also ensure that the scrollbar hit area is large enough for 
people who use touch input.


52. vertical-align: baseline, top, middle, bottom, sub, text-top.
The vertical-align CSS property sets vertical alignment of an 
inline, inline-block or table-cell box.

You can't use it to vertically align block-level elements.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align


53. place-content:
The place-content CSS shorthand property allows you to align content 
along both the block and inline directions at once in a relevant layout 
system such as Grid or Flexbox.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
align-content, justify-content

place-content: end space-between;
place-content: space-around start;
place-content: start space-evenly;
place-content: end center;
place-content: center end;


54. place-items:
The CSS place-items shorthand property allows you to align items 
along both the block and inline directions at once in a relevant 
layout system such as Grid or Flexbox. 

If the second value is not set, the first value is also used for 
it.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
align-items, justify-items.

place-items: center stretch;
place-items: center start;
place-items: start end;
place-items: end center;
place-items: center;


55. place-self:
The place-self CSS shorthand property allows you to align an 
individual item in both the block and inline directions at 
once in a relevant layout system such as Grid or Flexbox. 

If the second value is not present, the first value is also 
used for it.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
align-self, justify-self

place-self: center stretch;
place-self: center start;
place-self: start end;
place-self: end center;

57. flex-start:
It means the items are all aligned to the start of the main 
axis. 

While this may all seem a little confusing, the rule to remember 
is that unless you do something to change it, flex items lay 
themselves out in the direction that words are laid out in the 
language of your document along the inline, row axis. Start and 
flex-start will be where the beginning of a sentence of text 
would start.

If you change flex-direction to one of the reverse values, they will 
lay themselves out from the end axis and in the reverse order to the 
way words are written in the language of your document. Then, start 
and flex-start will change to the end of that axis — so to the 
location where your lines would wrap if working in rows, or at the 
end of your last paragraph of text in the block direction.


58. flex-end:
It means the items are all aligned to the end of the main axis. 
End and flex-end will be where the beginning of a sentence of 
text would end.


59. CSS box alignment

60. Types of alignment:
Positional alignment
Baseline alignment
Distributed alignment


Helpful Hints:
61. Border: 
Use border to check the initial width and height of an elemt.
It can also influence d space available for alignmt.


62. Padding:
It increases an elemt's width and height.

Every side of an elemt needs padding - it may only be 
applicable at d top & bottom in sm cases.

It can also be helpful in alignmt.


63. Width:
It smtimes affect alignmt.


64. Height and Width go hand in hand with space alignmt.


65. Projects:
Don't recollect what you crammed from a project but apply 
experiene and crictical thinking. 

Don't be quick to check soln.


66. CSS Values:
    Parent:
        height: auto;

    Inner Parent:
        height: 100%;

    Child:
        height: 55px;


68. Margin
margin: auto; 
may be very helpful.

*****************************************
HTML FORM elemt:
1. <!DOCTYPE html>
The whole essence of this is for the browser to know what 
type of document it's reading.


2. vh unit
It stands for viewport height, and is equal to 1% of the height 
of the viewport. This makes it relative to the viewport height.

body {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
}


3. Body Default Margin
The body has a default margin of 8px, wc may result in a 
horizontal scroll bar in case the whole page is used.

Get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default 
margin added by some browsers to 0.

body {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;

    margin: 0;
}


4. form action and method:
As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after 
the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting 
https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org.

The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL 
specified in the action attribute. 

The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters 
(with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request 
body (with method="post").

<form
    action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org"
    method="POST"
>

</form>


5. Fieldset
The <fieldset> HTML element is used to group several controls as 
well as labels (<label>) within a web form.

<form action="#">

    <fieldset>
        <legend>Choose your favorite monster</legend>

        <input 
            type="radio" 
            id="kraken" 
            name="monster" 
            value="K" 
        />
        <label for="kraken">Kraken</label>
        
        <br />

        OR: 

        Both "for" attribute and id attribute are nt needed 
        wn d input elemt is inside the label.

        <label>
            Kraken 

            <input 
                type="radio" 
                name="monster" 
                value="K" 
            />
        </label>
        
        <br />

        <input 
            type="radio" 
            id="sasquatch" 
            name="monster" 
            value="S" 
        />
        <label for="sasquatch">Sasquatch</label>

    </fieldset>

</form>


6. legend tag
The <legend> HTML element represents a caption or brief explanation 
for the content of its parent <fieldset>.

<fieldset>
    <legend>Choose your favorite monster</legend>

    <input type="radio" id="kraken" name="monster" value="K" />
    <label for="kraken">Kraken</label>
    
    <br />

    <input type="radio" id="sasquatch" name="monster" value="S" />
    <label for="sasquatch">Sasquatch</label>
</fieldset>


7. rem unit
The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size 
of the <html> element.


8. label
The <label> HTML element represents a caption/brief explanation 
for an item in a user interface.

To explicitly associate a <label> element with an <input> element, 
you first need to add the id attribute to the <input> element. Next, 
you add the for attribute to the <label> element, where the value 
of for is the same as the id in the <input> element.

Alternatively, you can nest the <input> directly inside the <label>, 
in which case the for and id attributes are not needed because the 
association is implicit:

As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed 
side by side on the same line. 

<label>
    Do you like peas?
    <input type="checkbox" name="peas" />
</label>


9. Input's "type" attribute
Specifying the "type" attribute of an input elemt of a form 
element is important for the browser to know what kind of 
data it should expect. 
If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.

The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the 
domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if 
the site does not use HTTPS.

A type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest 
parent form element.

<form 
    action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" 
    method="POST"
>

    ..................
    ..................

    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

type attribute can be: 
text, 
number, 
submit, 
radio, 
checkbox, 
password, 
email, 
file, 
date, 
month, 
week, 
time, 
datetime-local, 
range


10. required attribute
The Boolean required attribute, if present, indicates that the 
user must specify a value for the input before the owning form 
can be submitted.

The required attribute is supported by text, search, url, tel, 
email, password, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, 
checkbox, radio, file, <input> types along with the <select> and 
<textarea> form control elements. If present on any of these input 
types and elements, the :required pseudo class will match. If the 
attribute is not included, the :optional pseudo class will match.


11. minlength attribute
The minlength attribute defines the minimum string length that the 
user can enter into an <input> or <textarea>. The attribute must 
have an integer value of 0 or higher.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of maxlength, 
otherwise the value will never be valid, as it is impossible to 
meet both criteria.

For example: minlength="8"
By adding minlength="8", the value must either be empty or eight 
characters or longer to be valid.


12. pattern attribute 
The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression 
which the input's value must match for the value to pass 
constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular 
expression, as used by the RegExp type.

The pattern attribute is an attribute of the text, tel, email, 
url, password, and search input types.

[a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more 
lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5 and set minlength to 8. 

N.B: Since minlength is set with the regular expression there 
is no need for minlength attribute again.


13. name attribute
With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to 
provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This 
attribute is used to identify the element in the form 
submission.

To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute 
values.

<fieldset>
    <label for="">
        <input type="radio" name="account-type" />
        Personal
    </label>

    <label for="">
        <input type="radio" name="account-type" />
        Business
    </label>
</fieldset>


14. checked attribute
<input> elements of type checkbox are rendered by default 
as boxes that are checked (ticked) when activated, like you 
might see in an official government paper form. The exact 
appearance depends upon the operating system configuration 
under which the browser is running. Generally this is a 
square but it may have rounded corners. A checkbox allows 
you to select single values for submission in a form.

Providing a bigger hit area for your checkboxes:
In the above examples, you may have noticed that you can 
toggle a checkbox by clicking on its associated <label> 
element as well as on the checkbox itself. This is a 
really useful feature of HTML form labels that makes it 
easier to click the option you want, especially on 
small-screen devices like smartphones.

Beyond accessibility, this is another good reason to 
properly set up <label> elements on your forms.


15. min and max attributes

min: 
The min attribute defines the minimum value that is acceptable 
and valid for the input containing the attribute. If the value 
of the element is less than this, the element fails validation. 
This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max 
attribute.

It is valid for the input types including: date, month, week, 
time, datetime-local, number and range types, and the <meter> 
element.

max:
The max attribute defines the maximum value that is acceptable 
and valid for the input containing the attribute. If the value 
of the element is greater than this, the element fails validation. 
This value must be greater than or equal to the value of the min 
attribute. 

Valid for the numeric input types, including the date, month, 
week, time, datetime-local, number and range types, and both 
the <progress> and <meter> elements.


16. select elemt
Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. 
The select element is a container for a group of option elements, 
and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. 


17. option element
The <option> HTML element is used to define an item contained in 
a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, 
<option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of 
items in an HTML document.


18. option value
Each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, 
the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.

The content of this attribute represents the value to be submitted 
with the form, should this option be selected. If this attribute 
is omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option 
element.


19. selected attribute
You can include a selected attribute on an <option> element to 
make it selected by default when the page first loads.


The second value will be selected initially
<select name="choice">
    <option value="first">First Value</option>

    <option value="second" selected>Second Value</option>

    <option value="third">Third Value</option>
</select>


20. Textarea element
The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, 
but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive 
multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and 
columns.

To give textarea an initial size, you can add the rows and 
cols attributes.

<textarea 
    name="" 
    id="bio" 

    rows="3" 
    cols="30"
>
</textarea>


21. placeholder attribute
The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until 
the user starts typing.


22. Why this, using margin and text-align for the same purpose?

h1,
p {
    margin: 1em auto;
    text-align: center;
}


23. width:
form {
    min-width: 300px;

    width: 60vw;

    max-width: 500px;

    margin: 0 auto;
}

The actual width in this case is max-width: 500px.


24. last-of-type{}
The :last-of-type CSS pseudo-class represents the last element 
of its type among a group of sibling elements.

<p>This `p` is not selected.</p>

<p>This `p` is not selected either.</p>

<p>
    This `p` is last `p` element of its parent e.g. `body` selected by `p` type
    selector.
</p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="item">This `div` is not selected.</div>

    <div class="item">This `div` is not selected either.</div>

    <div class="item">
        This `div` is last `div` element of its parent `div` selected by `.container
        .item` class selector.
    </div>

    <p class="item">
        This `p` is last `p` element of its parent `div` selected by `.container
        .item` class selector.
    </p>
</div>

p:last-of-type {
    background: skyblue;
}

.container .item:last-of-type {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}


25. Input, Textarea and Select
Select all input, textarea, and select elements, and make them 
take up the full width of their parent elements.

input,
select,
textarea {
    width: 100%;
}


26. class attribute
This can be used to apply different styles to diffent elemt.

The case-sensitive class selector starts with a dot (.) 
character. It will select everything in the document with that 
class applied to it.

Target an element if it has more than one class applied:
You can apply multiple classes to an element and target them 
individually, or only select the element when all of the classes 
in the selector are present. This can be helpful when building 
up components that can be combined in different ways on your site.

E.g:
For the second fieldset, you want the input and label text to 
appear on the same line.

Start, by giving the input elements in the second fieldset a 
class of inline.


27. unset
The unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value 
if the property naturally inherits from its parent, and to its 
initial value if not. In other words, it behaves like the 
inherit keyword in the first case, when the property is an 
inherited property, and like the initial keyword in the second 
case, when the property is a non-inherited property.

That is, it can either be inherit if it has a parent or initial
if it doesn't. 

unset can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS 
shorthand property all.


28. attribute selector
input[name="password"]
The above selects input elements with a name attribute value 
of password.


29. What is the diff btw these:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />

and

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


30. ::before
In CSS, ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of 
the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an 
element with the content property. It is inline by default.

body::before {
    content: "";

    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
}

If the content property is not specified, has an invalid value, or 
has normal or none as a value, then the ::before pseudo-element is 
not rendered. It behaves as if display: none is set.

Using a ::before pseudo-element to add content is discouraged, as 
it is not reliably accessible to screen readers.


Examples
Adding quotation marks
One simple example of using ::before pseudo-elements is to provide 
quotation marks. Here we use both ::before and ::after to insert 
quotation characters.

<q>Some quotes</q>, he said, <q>are better than none.</q>

q::before {
    content: "«";
    color: blue;
}

q::after {
    content: "»";
    color: red;
}


31. background-clip:
The background-clip CSS property sets whether an element's background 
extends underneath its border box, padding box, or content box.

If the element has no background-image or background-color, this property 
will only have a visual effect when the border has transparent regions or 
partially opaque regions (due to border-style or border-image); otherwise, 
the border masks the difference.

Values:
border-box:
The background extends to the outside edge of the border (but underneath 
the border in z-ordering).

padding-box:
The background extends to the outside edge of the padding. No background 
is drawn beneath the border.

content-box:
The background is painted within (clipped to) the content box.

text:
The background is painted within (clipped to) the foreground text.


32. ease-in-out:
The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, 
then end slowly (this is default)

linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start 
to end

ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start

ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end

ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end

cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a 
cubic-bezier function


33. resize:
The resize CSS property sets whether an element is resizable, and if 
so, in which directions.

resize does not apply to the following:
Inline elements
Block elements for which the overflow property is set to visible

Values:
none
The element offers no user-controllable method for resizing it.

both
The element displays a mechanism for allowing the user to resize 
it, which may be resized both horizontally and vertically.

horizontal
The element displays a mechanism for allowing the user to resize 
it in the horizontal direction.

vertical
The element displays a mechanism for allowing the user to resize 
it in the vertical direction.

block
The element displays a mechanism for allowing the user to resize 
it in the block direction (either horizontally or vertically, 
depending on the writing-mode and direction value).

inline
The element displays a mechanism for allowing the user to resize 
it in the inline direction (either horizontally or vertically, 
depending on the writing-mode and direction value).


33. Responsive Design:
Design for mobile displays from 360×640 through 414×896

Design for tablet displays from 601×962 through 1280×800
f
Design for desktop displays from 1280×720 through 1920×1080


34. Background-attachment:
The background-attachment CSS property sets whether a background 
image's position is fixed within the viewport, or scrolls with 
its containing block.


35. Background:
    background: var(--color-darkblue);

    background-image: linear-gradient(
            115deg,
            rgba(58, 58, 158, 0.8),
            rgba(136, 136, 206, 0.7)
        ),
        url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/survey-form-background.jpeg);

    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;

    background-repeat: no-repeat;



*****************************************
Box-Model:

1. Box-Model:
Box-Model: is all about spacing and a border.

The content:
The content has width and height and is the main element
on d page.

The padding:
The content is surrounded by a space called padding.

The border:
is d separation (space) btw padding (inside) and margin 
(outside).

The margin:
Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to 
control the space between other boxes or elements.


2. Every painting needs a frame.
What does this means? 

It means every element needs a container.


3. If smth is too wide change its width.


4. margin: 20px auto;
U add ds to the elemt/container to be centered; an elemt
/container with a width ppty. 


5. overflow: hidden;
ds is added to d parent elemt dt contains d elemt dt
is overflowing.


6. background-color & background
Wn do use background-color and background.

background-color is one of d components of background just 
like how background-image is also one of it. 
Background encompases everyth starting with background-....


7. filter:
The filter CSS property applies graphical effects like blur or 
color shift to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust 
the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.

Several functions, such as blur() and contrast(), are available 
to help you achieve predefined effects.

e.g.:
filter: blur/contrast(value with unit)

filter: blur(5px);
filter: contrast(200%);

filter: grayscale(80%);
filter: hue-rotate(90deg);

filter: drop-shadow(16px 16px 20px red) invert(75%);

When the filter property values contains multiple functions, the 
filters are applied in order.


8. transform:
The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or 
translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the 
CSS visual formatting model.

Warning: Only transformable elements can be transformed. That is, 
all elements whose layout is governed by the CSS box model except 
for: non-replaced inline boxes, table-column boxes, and 
table-column-group boxes.

transform: matrix(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
transform: translate(120px, 50%);

transform: scale(2, 0.5);
transform: rotate(0.5turn);

transform: skew(30deg, 20deg);
transform: scale(0.5) translate(-100%, -100%);

3.
In order to better visualize how your elements are sized, adding 
a border can be helpful.


4. box-sizing
content-box:
With this model, when an element has a specific width, that width 
is calculated based only on the element's content. Padding and 
border values get added to the total width, so the element grows 
to accommodate these values.

border-box:
The total width of the element, including padding and border, will 
be the explicit width set. The content of the element will shrink 
to make room for the padding and border.


5.
Now your images are too big.

Create a .gallery img selector to target them. Give them all a width 
of 100% and a max-width of 350px. 

Also set the height property to 300px to keep your images a uniform 
size.


6. text-transform


7. Flexbox
Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout that can control the way 
items are spaced out and aligned within a container.

To use it, give an element a display property of flex. This will 
make the element a flex container. Any direct children of a flex 
container are called flex items.

Flexbox has a main and cross axis. 


8. flex-direction:
Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by 
the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:
row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse.


9. flex-wrap:
Makes your flex items wrap or not wrap to the next row when 
they run out of space.


10. justify-content
The justify-content property determines how the items inside a 
flex container are positioned along the MAIN AXIS. 

ds affects their position and the space around them.


11. align-items
The align-items property positions the flex content along the 
CROSS AXIS. 


12. max-width: 1400px;


13. object-fit
It is used to determine how images should behave.
It is applied on d image selector.

object-fit: cover;
This will tell the image to fill the img container while 
maintaining aspect ratio, resulting in cropping to fit.


14. gaps:
The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps, also known as gutters, 
between rows and columns. 

The gap property and its row-gap and column-gap sub-properties provide 
this functionality for flex, grid, and multi-column layout. You apply 
the property to the container element. 

It is applied on d flex-container


15. ::after pseudo-element
The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child 
of the selected element. You can use it to add an empty element after 
the last elemt. 

In ds case, d pseudo-elemt is applied on d flex-container.


16.
.gallery {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 16px;


    /* ds align d items inside d container to center */
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;


    /* ds align d container at d max-width specified */
    max-width: 1400px;
    margin: 0 auto;


    padding: 20px 10px;
}


17. ds values can still mks a gd UI even though dy r nt d same:

max-width: 350px;
height: 300px;


*****************************************
Typography:

1. Typography is the art of styling your text to be easily 
readable and suit its purpose.

This may involve styling text, adjusting line height, and 
positioning your text using CSS.

Typography is often more art than science. You may have to 
tweak things like alignment until it looks correct.


2. Font-family:
Fonts with spaces in the name must be wrapped in quotes 
for CSS.

font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;


3. Borders:
Borders can be used to group and prioritize content.

E.g:
.daily-value p:not(.no-divider) {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #888989;
}

Use of lines/border-bottom:
Lines/borders can help separate and group important 
content, especially when space is limited.


4. Spacing:
Good use of white space can bring focus to the important 
elements of your page, and help guide your user's eyes 
through your text.

Spacing can be horizontal or vertical.


5. Box-sizing:
By default, the browser includes the border and padding 
when determining an element's size.


6. Semantic structure
The use of h1, h2, and similar tags determine the semantic 
structure of your HTML. 


7. Letter/word spacing
The letter/word-spacing property can be used to adjust the 
space between each character/word of text in an element.

The letter-spacing CSS property sets the horizontal spacing 
behavior between text characters. This value is added to the 
natural spacing between characters while rendering the text. 

Positive values of letter-spacing causes characters to spread 
farther apart, while negative values of letter-spacing bring 
characters closer together.

normal:
The normal letter spacing for the current font. Unlike a value 
of 0, this keyword allows the user agent to alter the space 
between characters in order to justify text.

Horizontal spacing between equally important elements can 
increase the readability of your text.


8. General class attribute:
For instance, rather than targeting each element that needs 
to be bold (individually with CSS), it is more efficient to 
declare a class named bold (a single css rule) to apply the 
bold styling to every element. 

.bold {
    font-weight: 800;
}

.divider {
    border: 1px solid #888989
}


9. Specificity:
Header h1 specifically target h1 element within d header 
elemt alone.


10. rem unit:
The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font 
size of the html element.

Wn do u use em or rem for font-size?
The em unit means "my parent element's font-size" if used for 
font-size (and "my own font-size" when used for anything else).

The <li> elements inside the <ul> with a class of ems take their 
sizing from their parent. So each successive level of nesting gets 
progressively larger, as each has its font size set to 1.3em — 
1.3 times its parent element's font size. 

That is, if d 1st parent is 20.8px (16px × 1.3), d next parent will 
be 27.04px (20.8px × 1.3) and d next parent will be 35.15px 
(27.04px × 1.3) and so on.


<ul class="ems">
    <li>One</li>                        (20.8px)    
    <li>Two</li>                        (20.8px)

    <li>Three
        <ul>
            <li>Three A</li>            (27.04px)

            <li>
                Three B
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Three B 2</li>  (35.15px)
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul class="rems">
    <li>One</li>                            (16px)
    <li>Two</li>                            (16px)

    <li>Three
        <ul>
            <li>Three A</li>                (16px)

            <li>
                Three B
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Three B 2</li>      (16px)
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

html {
    font-size: 16px;
}

.ems li {
    font-size: 1.3em;   (20.8px that is: 16px × 1.3)
}

.rems li {
    font-size: 1.3rem;  (20.8px)
}

The rem unit means "The root element's font-size" (rem stands for 
"root em"). The <li> elements inside the <ul> with a class of rems 
take their sizing from the root element (<html>). This means that 
each successive level of nesting does not keep getting larger.


11. Flex-end:
Items are positioned either vertically or horizontally at the end 
of the container.

align-items: flex-end;
justify-content: end/flex-end;

Any diff btw end and flex-end? No.


12. Absord behaviour of display: flex ppty:
Can justify-content or align-items be used on an elemt even wn 
display: flex is not declared?

Yes, see Nutrition Label HTML/CSS Class work.


13. :not pseudo-selector:
:not pseudo-selector can be used to select all elements that do 
not match the given CSS rule inside d :not() fxn.

.daily-value p:not(.no-divider) {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #888989;
}

This means apply border-bottom to all paragraph elemts 
without .no-divider class attribute.


14. Italics:
You can italicize a word by wrapping it in an i tag.

<i>italic word</i>


15. Text-indent:
The text-indent CSS property sets the length of empty space 
(indentation) that is put before lines of text in a block.

Horizontal spacing is with respect to the left (for left-to-right
layout or right, for right-to-left layout) edge of the containing 
block-level element's content box.


16. flex:
The flex CSS shorthand property sets how a flex item will grow 
or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis

The flex property may be specified using one, two, or three 
values.


17. Properties for controlling alignment in flexbox. The 
properties are as follows.

justify-content: 
Controls the alignment of ALL items on the main axis.

align-items: 
Controls the alignment of ALL items on the cross axis.

align-self: 
Controls the alignment of AN individual flex item on the 
cross axis.

align-content: 
Controls the space between flex lines on the cross axis.

When flex items are allowed to WRAP across multiple lines, 
the align-content property can be used to control the 
distribution of space between the lines.

gap, column-gap, and row-gap: 
Used to create gaps or gutters between flex items.


18. Using auto margins for main axis alignment:
We don't have a justify-items or justify-self property available 
to us on the main axis as our items are treated as a group on that 
axis. 

However it is possible to do some individual alignment in order 
to separate an item or a group of items from others by using auto 
margins along with flexbox (provided d container still has some 
available space).

A common pattern is a navigation bar where some key items are 
aligned to the right, with the main group on the left.

E.g:
<div class="box">
    <div>One</div>
    <div>Two</div>
    <div>Three</div>

    <div class="push">Four</div>

    <div>Five</div>
</div>

.box {
    display: flex;
}
.push {
    margin-left: auto;
}




*****************************************
Accessiblity:
Accessibility is making your webpage easy for all people to 
use – even people with disabilities.

Such as: 
keyboard shortcuts, 
ARIA attributes, and 
design best practices.


1. Html tag:
<html lang="en">

This will assist screen readers in identifying the language 
of the page.


2. Meta tags:
<meta charset="UTF-8" />

It is used to specify information about the page, such as 
the title, description, keywords, and author.

<meta 
    name="viewport" 
    content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" 
/>

A viewport definition tells the browser how to render the 
page. Including betters visual accessibility on mobile, 
and improves SEO (search engine optimization).

Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is 
the description definition. 

The value of the content attribute is used by search engines 
to provide a description of your page.

<meta
    name="description"
    content="Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz"
/>


3. Title tag:
The title element is useful for screen readers to understand 
the content of a page. Furthermore, it is an important part 
of SEO. 

<title>
    Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz
</title>


4. Semantics
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece 
of code — for example "what effect does running that line of 
JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML 
element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

Semantics in JavaScript
In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, 
and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. 
Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function 
did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

Semantics in CSS
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing 
different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM 
is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

Semantics in HTML
In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, 
which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of 
"a top level heading on your page."

<h1>
    This is a top level heading
</h1>

By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an 
h1 with a large font size to make it look like a heading 
(although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).

On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top 
level heading. 

Consider the following:

<span 
    style="font-size: 32px; 
    margin: 21px 0;"
>
    Not a top-level heading!
</span>

This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has 
no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as 
described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right 
HTML element for the right job.

HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated 
and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation 
(how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:
a. Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords 
to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO).

b. Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually 
impaired users navigate a page.

c. Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier 
than searching through endless divs with or without semantic 
or namespaced classes.

d. Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be 
populated.

e. Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.

These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:
<article>
<aside>

<details>

<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<form>

<header>

<main>
<mark>

<nav>

<section>
<summary>

<time>

Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and screen readers 
rely on you to provide the structure of your page. 

This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements. Such as:
Header tag
Main tag
Footer tag

The header element will be used to introduce the page, as well 
as provide a navigation menu.

The main element will contain the core content of your page.


5. min() and max() functions:

min():
The min() CSS function lets you set the smallest (most negative) 
value from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of 
a CSS property value. 

The min() function takes one or more comma-separated expressions 
as its parameter, with the smallest expression value result used 
as the value.

e.g:
width: min(50vw, 200px); 
    
In the above example, the width will be at most 200px, but will 
be smaller if the viewport is less than 400px wide (in which 
case 1vw would be 4px, so 50vw would be 200px). 

This technique uses an absolute unit(200px) to specify a fixed 
maximum value for the property, and a relative unit (50vw) to 
allow the value to SHRINK to suit smaller viewports.
    
max()
CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of 
comma-separated values. 

The max() CSS function lets you set the largest (most positive) 
value from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of 
a CSS property value. 

The max() function takes one or more comma-separated expressions 
as its parameter, with the largest (most positive) expression 
value used as the value of the property to which it is assigned.

e.g
width: max(20vw, 400px); 

In the example shown above, the width will be at least 400px, 
but will be wider if the viewport is more than 2000px wide 
(in which case 1vw would be 20px, so 20vw would be 400px). 

This technique uses an absolute unit to specify a fixed minimum 
value for the property, and a relative unit to allow the value 
to GROW to suit larger viewports.

For example:

img {
    width: max(250px, 25vw);
    
    or:

    width: max(25vw, 250px);
}

In this example, img elements will have a minimum width of 250px. 
And as the viewport grows, the image will GROW accordingly to be 
25 percent of the viewport width.

The min() and max() function can be used either as a <length>, 
<frequency>, <angle>, <time>, <percentage>, <number>, or <integer> 
is allowed.


6. aspect-ratio:
The aspect-ratio CSS property allows you to define the desired 
width-to-height ratio of an element's box. This means that even 
if the parent container or viewport size changes, the browser 
will adjust the element's dimensions to maintain the specified 
WIDTH-TO-HEIGHT ratio. 

The specified aspect ratio is used in the calculation of auto 
sizes and some other layout functions.

At least one of the box's sizes needs to be automatic in order 
for aspect-ratio to have any effect. If neither the width nor 
height is an automatic size, then the provided aspect ratio 
has no effect on the box's preferred sizes.

This property is specified as one or both of the keyword auto 
or a <ratio>. If both are given, and the element is a replaced 
element, such as <img>, then the given ratio is used until the 
content is loaded. After the content is loaded, the auto value 
is applied, so the intrinsic aspect ratio of the loaded content 
is used.

If the element is not a replaced element, then the given ratio 
is used.


7. Nav tag and list items:
<nav>: The Navigation Section element
The <nav> HTML element represents a section of a page whose 
purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the 
current document or to other documents. 

Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of 
contents, and indexes.

Usage notes:
It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a <nav> 
element. <nav> is intended only for a major block of navigation 
links; typically the <footer> element often has a list of links 
that don't need to be in a <nav> element.

A document may have several <nav> elements, for example, one for 
site navigation and one for intra-page navigation. 

aria-labelledby can be used in such case to promote accessibility.

Examples
<nav class="menu">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="#">Home</a>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="#">About</a>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <a href="#">Contact</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</nav>

In this example, a <nav> block is used to contain an unordered 
list (<ul>) of links. With appropriate CSS, this can be presented 
as a sidebar, navigation bar, or drop-down menu.

The list items text should be wrapped in anchor tags.

The semantics of the nav element is that of providing links. 
However a nav element doesn't have to contain a list, it can 
contain other kinds of content as well. In this navigation block,
links are provided in prose:

<nav>
    <h2>Navigation</h2>

    <p>
        You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, 
        from whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see 
        a large mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> 
        are littered. Far up this mountain you can spy a little figure who 
        appears to be me, desperately scribbling a 
        <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled
        <a href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more
        boring-looking exit is labeled 
        <a href="https://isp.example.net/">ISP™</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts page</a>.
        Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run
        quickly out of the page.
    </p>
</nav>


8. Child combinator selector: >
The child combinator selector > is used between selectors to 
target only elements that match the second selector and are a 
DIRECT child of the first selector.

li > a {}


9. <section>: The Generic Section element:
The <section> HTML element represents a generic stand alone 
section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific 
semantic element to represent it. 

Sections should always have a heading, with very few 
exceptions.

<h1>Choosing an Apple</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        This document provides a guide to help with the 
        important task of choosing the correct Apple.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Criteria</h2>

    <p>
        There are many different criteria to be considered 
        when choosing an Apple — size, color, firmness, 
        sweetness, tartness...
    </p>
</section>


10. role attribute:
The role attribute describes the role of an element in programs 
that can make use of it, such as screen readers or magnifiers.

Usage Example:
<a 
    href="#" 
    role="button"
>
    Button Link
</a>

Screen Readers will read this element as “button” instead of “link”.

To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used 
to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive 
technologies. 

<section role="region"></section>

Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users 
understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label 
is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it 
with the aria-labelledby attribute.

e.g:
<section 
    role="region" 
    aria-labelledby="html-questions"
>
    <h2 id="html-questions">HTML</h2>
</section>


11. aria attributes:
Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles 
and attributes that define ways to make web content and web 
applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more 
accessible to people with disabilities.

It supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used 
in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there 
is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible 
JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content 
updates, and more.

Warning: Many of these widgets are fully supported in modern browsers. 
Developers should prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over 
using ARIA, if such an element exists. For instance, native elements 
have built-in keyboard accessibility, roles and states. However, if 
you choose to use ARIA, you are responsible for mimicking the 
equivalent browser behavior in script.

The first rule of ARIA use is "If you can use a native HTML element 
or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already 
built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, 
state or property to make it accessible, then do so."

Note: There is a saying "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA." In WebAim's 
survey of over one million home pages, they found that Home pages with
ARIA present averaged 41% more detected errors than those without ARIA. 
While ARIA is designed to make web pages more accessible, if used 
incorrectly, it can do more harm than good.

Here's the markup for a progress bar widget:

<div
    id="percent-loaded"

    role="progressbar"

    aria-valuenow="75"

    aria-valuemin="0"
    aria-valuemax="100">
</div>

This progress bar is built using a <div>, which has no meaning. 

We include ARIA roles and properties to add meaning. In this 
example, the role="progressbar" attribute informs the browser 
that this element is actually a JavaScript-powered progress bar 
widget. 

The aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax attributes specify the 
minimum and maximum values for the progress bar, and the 
aria-valuenow describes the current state of it and therefore 
must be kept updated with JavaScript.

Along with placing them directly in the markup, ARIA attributes 
can be added to the element and updated dynamically using 
JavaScript code like this:

// Find the progress bar <div> in the DOM.
const progressBar = document.getElementById("percent-loaded");

/* Set its ARIA roles and states, so that assistive technologies 
know what kind of widget it is. */
progressBar.setAttribute("role", "progressbar");
progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuemin", 0);
progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuemax", 100);

/* Create a function that can be called at any time to update
the value of the progress bar. */

function updateProgress(percentComplete) {
    progressBar.setAttribute("aria-valuenow", percentComplete);
}

All content that is available to non-assistive technology users must 
be made available to assistive technologies. Similarly, no features 
should be included targeting assistive technology users that aren't 
also accessible to those not using assistive technologies. The above 
progressbar needs to be styled to make it look like a progressbar.

It would have been much simpler to use the native <progress> element 
instead:

<progress 
    id="percent-loaded" 
    value="75" 
    max="100"
>
    75 %
</progress>

Note: The min attribute is not allowed for the <progress> element; its 
minimum value is always 0.

Note: HTML landmark elements (<main>, <header>, <nav>, etc.) have 
built-in implicit ARIA roles, so there is no need to duplicate them.


12. aria-labelledby:
The aria-labelledby attribute identifies the element (or elements) 
that labels the element it is applied to.

The aria-labelledby attribute is used to give elements an accessible 
name. The accessible name is used by assistive technology, primarily 
screen readers, to help the user distinguish an element from other 
elements on the page.

In this case, there are three regions on the page. Screen reader users 
are able to navigate a page by these regions. Without an accessible 
name a screen reader user will just hear “region” when they navigate 
to each of these regions, so they won’t be able to tell which one they 
are on. By adding an accessible name with aria-labelledby they will 
hear the name of the region as well, so now they will know which 
region they are currently on.


13. Linking d nav items with a section of d pg:
To be able to navigate within the page, give each anchor element 
in the nav section an href corresponding to the id of the h2 
(target) elements.


14. SVG:
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a unique type of 
image format for vector-based graphics written in Extensible 
Markup Language (XML).

SVG has elements and attributes for rectangles, circles, ellipses, 
lines, polygons, curves, and more.

SVG also supports filter and blur effects, gradients, rotations, 
animations, interactivity with JavaScript, and more.

A simple SVG document consists of the <svg> root element and 
several basic shape elements that will build a graphic together.


15. path attribute:
The <path> SVG element is the generic element to define a shape. 
All the basic shapes can be created with a path element.

<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <path
        d="M 10,30
            A 20,20 0,0,1 50,30
            A 20,20 0,0,1 90,30
            Q 90,60 50,90
            Q 10,60 10,30 z" 
    />
</svg>

d:
This attribute defines the shape of the path. Value type: <string> ; 
Default value: ''; Animatable: yes


16. placeholder:

<div class="info">
    <label for="student-name">Name:</label>

    <input
    id="student-name"

        type="text"
        name="student-name"
        placeholder="e.g Quincy Larson"
    />
</div>

Even though you added a placeholder to the input element 
this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too 
often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual 
input value - they think there is already a value in the 
input. Remove the placeholder text from the input element, 
relying on the label being the best-practice.


17. sr-only:
Arguably, D.O.B. is not descriptive enough. This is especially 
true for visually impaired users. One way to get around such 
an issue, without having to add visible text to the label, is 
to add text only a screen reader can read.

Append a span element with a class of sr-only to the current 
text content of the third label element.

<div class="info">
    <label for="birth-date">
        D.O.B.
    
        <span class="sr-only"></span>
    </label>

    <input type="date" name="birth-date" id="birth-date" />
</div>

.sr-only {
    position: absolute;

    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;

    padding: 0;
    margin: -1px;

    overflow: hidden;
    clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);

    white-space: nowrap;

    border: 0;
}

18. for attribute:
Although not required for label elements with a nested input, 
it is still best-practice to explicitly link a label with its 
corresponding input element.


19. input's value attribute
The value attribute specifies the value of an <input> element.
It is a string that contains the current value of the text 
entered into the text field. You can retrieve this using the 
HTMLInputElement value property in JavaScript.

js
let theText = myTextInput.value;

The value attribute is used differently for different input 
types:

For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on 
the button

For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial 
(default) value of the input field

For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated 
with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)

Note: The value attribute cannot be used with <input type="file">.


20. pseudo elemt:
A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you 
style a specific part of the selected element(s).

selector::pseudo-element {
    property: value;
}

For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first 
line of a paragraph.

/* The first line of every <p> element. */
p::first-line {
    color: blue;
    text-transform: uppercase;
}


To prevent unnecessary repetition, target the before 
pseudo-element of the p element, and give it a content 
property of "Question #".

p::before{
    content:"Question #"
}

Double colons (::) are used for pseudo-elements. This 
distinguishes pseudo-elements from pseudo-classes that 
use a single colon (:) in their notation.

Pseudo-elements do not exist independently. The element of 
which a pseudo-element is a part is called its originating 
element. A pseudo-element must appear after all the other 
components in the complex or compound selector. The last 
element in the selector is the originating element of the 
pseudo-element. 

For example, you can select a paragraph's first line using 
p::first-line but not the first-line's children. 
So p::first-line > * is invalid.

A pseudo-element can be selected based on the current state 
of the originating element. 

For example, p:hover::first-line selects the first line 
(pseudo-element) of a paragraph when the paragraph itself is 
being hovered (pseudo-class).

Note: When a selector list contains an invalid selector, the 
entire style block is ignored.

A
::after

B
::backdrop
::before

C
::cue (and ::cue())

F
::file-selector-button
::first-letter
::first-line

G
::grammar-error

H
::highlight()

M
::marker

P
::part()
::placeholder

S
::selection
::slotted()
::spelling-error

T
::target-text Experimental

V
::view-transition
::view-transition-image-pair()
::view-transition-group()
::view-transition-new()
::view-transition-old()


21. footer elemt
The footer element is a container for a collection of content 
that is related to the page.

A <footer> typically contains information about the author of 
the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

It encloses information about the author in an <address> element 
that can be included into the <footer> element.

When the nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root 
element is the body element the footer applies to the whole page.

The <footer> element is not sectioning content and therefore 
doesn't introduce a new section in the outline.


22. address elemt
The address element is a container for contact information for 
the author of the page.

The address element does not have to contain a physical 
geographical location. It can be used to provide a link to the 
subject. 

The <address> HTML element indicates that the enclosed HTML 
provides contact information for a person or people, or for 
an organization.

<address> can be used in a variety of contexts, such as providing 
a business's contact information in the page header, or indicating 
the author of an article by including an <address> element within 
the <article>.


23. br, break tag
The br tag will allow each part of the address to be on its own 
line.


24.
On the topic of visual accessibility, contrast between elements 
is a key factor. For example, the contrast between the text and 
the background of a heading should be at least 4.5:1.

For visual accessibility, there must be a perfect contrast btw
the text and the background.


25.
The <li> HTML element is used to represent an item in a list. It 
must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<ol>), an 
unordered list (<ul>), or a menu (<menu>).

li:
    display: list-item;

Eg:
<div class="fake-list">
    I will display as a list item
</div>

.fake-list {
    display: list-item;
    list-style-position: inside;
}


26. padding-inline-start:
The padding-inline-start CSS property defines the logical inline 
start padding of an element, which maps to a physical padding 
depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text 
orientation.

In English, a left-to-right top-to-bottom language, the 
padding-inline-start property for this paragraph of text 
corresponds to the padding-top property. However, whether this 
logical property corresponds to the padding-top, padding-right, 
or padding-bottom, or padding-left depends on the element's 
writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation.

It relates to padding-block-start, padding-block-end, and 
padding-inline-end, which define the other paddings of the 
element.

padding-inline-start: 0;


27. margin-block:
The margin-block CSS shorthand property defines the logical block 
start and end margins of an element, which maps to physical margins 
depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text 
orientation.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
margin-block-start
margin-block-end

margin-block: 10px 20px;
writing-mode: horizontal-tb;


28.
To align the input boxes with each other, create a new ruleset 
that targets all input and label elements within an .info 
element and set the display property to inline-block.

Also, align the label element's text to the right.

.info > label, .info > input {
    display: inline-block;
}

.info > label {
    width: 10%;
    min-width: 55px;

    text-align: right;
}


29. scroll-behavior:
The scroll-behavior CSS property sets the behavior for a scrolling 
box when scrolling is triggered by the navigation or CSSOM scrolling 
APIs.

Note that any other scrolls, such as those performed by the user, are 
not affected by this property. When this property is specified on the 
root element, it applies to the viewport instead. 

This property specified on the body element will not propagate to the 
viewport.

Values:
auto: The scrolling box scrolls instantly.

smooth: The scrolling box scrolls in a smooth fashion using a 
user-agent-defined easing function over a user-agent-defined period 
of time. User agents should follow platform conventions, if any.

scroll-behavior: smooth;


30. prefers-reduced-motion:
The prefers-reduced-motion CSS media feature is used to detect if a 
user has enabled a setting on their device to minimize the amount of 
non-essential motion. The setting is used to convey to the browser 
on the device that the user prefers an interface that removes, reduces, 
or replaces motion-based animations.

Such animations can trigger discomfort for those with vestibular motion 
disorders. Animations such as scaling or panning large objects can be 
vestibular motion triggers.

The @media at-rule has a media feature called 
prefers-reduced-motion to set CSS based on the user's 
preferences. 

It can take one of the following values:
reduce
no-preference

no-preference:
Indicates that a user has made no preference known on the device. This 
keyword value evaluates as false.

reduce:
Indicates that a user has enabled the setting on their device for reduced 
motion. This keyword value evaluates as true.

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
    * {
        scroll-behavior: smooth;
    }
}



31. accesskey attribute:
The accesskey global attribute provides a hint for generating a keyboard 
shortcut for the current element. The attribute value must consist of a 
single printable character (which includes accented and other characters 
that can be generated by the keyboard).

Note: It is not always advised to use access keys, but they 
can be useful.

The way to activate the accesskey depends on the browser and its platform:
Firefox:
Alt + Shift + key

Edge, Google Chrome:
Alt + key


32. clip-path:
The clip-path CSS property creates a clipping region that sets what part 
of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, 
while those outside are hidden.

clip-path: ellipse(130px 140px at 10% 20%);


33. Typeface: 
Typeface plays an important role in the accessibility of a page. 
Some fonts are easier to read than others, and this is especially 
true on low-resolution screens.

Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers 
experience a website.

The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.

Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds 
value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct 
color and text size for the font.


In CSS there are five generic font families:
a. Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They 
create a sense of formality and elegance.

b. Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They 
create a modern and minimalistic look.

c. Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. 
They create a mechanical look. 

d. Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.

e. Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.

All the different font names belong to one of the generic font 
families. 

Serif e.g:
Times New Roman
Georgia
Garamond

Sans-serif e.g:
Arial
Verdana
Helvetica
Tahoma

Monospace e.g:
Courier New
Lucida Console
Monaco

Cursive e.g:
Brush Script MT
Lucida Handwriting

Fantasy e.g:
Copperplate
Papyrus


34. progress tag:
The <progress> HTML element displays an indicator showing the 
completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress 
bar.

In most cases you should provide an accessible label when using 
<progress>. While you can use the standard ARIA labelling 
attributes aria-labelledby or aria-label as you would for any 
element with role="progressbar", when using <progress> you can 
alternatively use the <label> element.

The <progress> tag represents the completion progress of a task.

Tip: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices!


35. content property:
The content CSS property replaces content with a generated value. 
It can be used to define what is rendered inside an element or 
pseudo-element. For elements, the content property specifies whether 
the element renders normally (normal or none) or is replaced with 
an image (and associated "alt" text). For pseudo-elements and margin 
boxes, content defines the content as images, text, both, or none, 
which determines whether the element renders at all.

Objects inserted using the content property are anonymous replaced 
elements.


36. clip:
Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some 
browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed 
from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being 
dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes.

Warning: Where possible, authors are encouraged to use the newer 
clip-path property instead.


*****************************************

1. aria-hidden:
You want this particular element to be hidden from screen 
readers, so give it the aria-hidden attribute set to true.

<div 
    id="years" 
    aria-hidden="true">
</div>


2. caption element:
HTML tables use the caption element to describe what the table is 
about. The caption element should always be the first child of a 
table, but can be positioned with the caption-side CSS property.


3. caption-side:
The caption-side CSS property puts the content of a table's
<caption> on the specified side. The values are relative to 
the writing-mode of the table.

caption-side: top;
caption-side: bottom;


4. thead and tbody:
The thead and tbody elements are used to indicate which portion of 
your table is the header, and which portion contains the primary 
data or content i.e body.


5. tr:
The tr element is used to indicate a table row.


6. td, th:
The td element indicates a data cell, while the th element indicates 
a header cell. (That is, t in td and th stands for cell).


7. Is this:
html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

the same as this:
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

?
No. It is not. 
Use this for illustration:

html {
    border: 2px solid blue;
}

* {
    border: 2px solid blue;
}


8. You can use CSS to make elements completely hidden from 
the visual page, but still be announced by screen readers.

E.G:
span[class~="sr-only"] {
    border: 0 !important;

    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;
    clip-path: inset(50%) !important;

    width: 1px !important;
    height: 1px !important;

    overflow: hidden !important;
    white-space: nowrap !important;

    position: absolute !important;
    padding: 0 !important;
    margin: -1px !important;
}


9. span[class~="sr-only"]: 
The span[class~="sr-only"] selector will select any span 
element whose class includes sr-only.

~= i.e d class(es) include the value specified.


10. border: 0;  means?
The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. 
It sets the values of border-width, border-style, and border-color.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
border-width
border-style
border-color

border: 0 or none;
Both are valid. It's your choice. I prefer border:0 because it's 
shorter; I find that easier to read. You may find none more legible.


11. Explanation of:

span[class~="sr-only"] {
    border: 0;

    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
    clip-path: inset(50%);

    height: 1px;
    width: 1px;

    overflow: hidden;
    white-space: nowrap;

    position: absolute;
    padding: 0;
    margin: -1px;
}

The CSS clip property is used to define the visible portions of 
an element.

The clip-path property determines the shape the clip property 
should take.
Set the clip-path property to the value of inset(50%), forming 
the clip-path into a rectangle within the element.

You need to size these elements down. Give your 
span[class~="sr-only"] selector a width and height property set 
to 1px.

To prevent the text content from overflowing, give your 
span[class~="sr-only"] selector an overflow property set to hidden 
and a white-space property set to nowrap.

Relatnship btw white-space and overflow:
white-space: nowrap results in overflow

I tried to solve it with white-space:nowrap; property on the 
description, but the problem is, that if the description is 
very long, it overflows the container.

This means there is tendency for white-space: nowrap; to result
in overflow.

Finally, you need to take these hidden elements out of the 
document flow. Give the span[class~="sr-only"] selector a 
position property set to absolute, a padding property set to 0, 
and a margin property set to -1px. This will ensure that not 
only are they no longer visible, but they are not even within 
the page view.

    position: absolute;
    padding: 0;
    margin: -1px;


12. h1
h1 can also be given width(max-width in ds case). This was hwever
used to center the h1 text.

h1 {
    max-width: 37.25rem; /* 596px */
    margin: 0 auto;

    padding: 1.5rem 1.25rem; /* 24px 20px */
}


13. column-reverse:
Behaves the same as column but the main-start and main-end 
are opposite to the content direction.

It displays the nested elements from bottom to top.


14. :first-of-type & :last-of-type
The :first-of-type pseudo-selector is used to target the first 
element that matches the selector. 

<h1>
    <span class="flex">
        <span>AcmeWidgetCorp</span>
        <span>Balance Sheet</span>
    </span>
</h1>

h1 .flex {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column-reverse;

    gap: 1rem;
}

h1 .flex span:first-of-type {
    font-size: 0.7em; /* 16.8px */

    1em = 24px
    1rem = 16px
}

The :last-of-type pseudo-selector targets the last element that 
matches the selector. 

h1 .flex span:last-of-type {
    font-size: 1.2em; /* 19.2px */
}


15.
You wrapped your table in a section element - now you can style 
that to give your table a border.

section {
    border: 2px solid #d0d0d5;

    max-width: 40rem;
    margin: 0 auto;
}


16.
The last part of your table heading is your years. Create a #years 
selector, and enable flexbox. Justify the content to the end of the 
flex direction, and make the element sticky. Fix it to the top of 
its container with top: 0.

#years {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-end;

    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
}
    

17. calc() function
The calc() function is a CSS function that allows you to calculate 
a value based on other values. 

For example, you can use it to calculate the width of the viewport
minus the margin of an element:

.example {
    margin: 10px;
    width: calc(100% - 20px);
}


18. z-index:
Adding position sticky moved the element into its own stack. To 
ensure your #years element does not get hidden by different stacks, 
add a z-index property set to 999 in the #years rule.

The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element 
and its descendants or flex and grid items. Overlapping elements 
with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.


19. span[class]:
<div id="years" aria-hidden="true">
    <span class="year">2019</span>
    <span class="year">2020</span>
    <span class="year">2021</span>
</div>

The span[class] syntax will target any span element that has a 
class attribute set, regardless of the attribute's value.

#years span[class] {
    font-weight: bold;
    width: 4.5rem;
    text-align: right;
}


20. font-weight: normal;
normal:
Normal font weight. Same as 400.


21.:not() pseudo-selector
The :not() pseudo-selector is used to target all elements that do 
not match the selector (quoted inside d not() fxn)- in this case, 
any of your span elements that do not have the sr-only class will
have a normal(400) font-weight.

span:not(.sr-only) {
    font-weight: normal;
}


22. !important
Rather than having to constantly double-check you are not 
overwriting your earlier properties, you can use the !important 
keyword to ensure these properties are always applied, regardless 
of order or specificity.

span[class~="sr-only"] {
    border: 0 !important;

    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;
    clip-path: inset(50%) !important;

    width: 1px !important;
    height: 1px !important;

    overflow: hidden !important;
    white-space: nowrap !important;

    position: absolute !important;
    padding: 0 !important;
    margin: -1px !important;
}

Note where the !important is placed.

Best practices:
Avoid using !important to override specificity. When intentionally 
creating important declarations for UI requirements, comment in 
your CSS code to explain to maintainers why they should not override 
that feature.


23.
Now that you have added the !important keyword, you can remove the 
:not(.sr-only) from your span selector.

span {
    font-weight: normal;
}


24. border-collapse: 
border-collapse allows cell borders to collapse into a single 
border, instead of a border around each cell. Also set the 
border property to 0 to hide the borders themselves.

The border-collapse CSS property sets whether cells inside a 
<table> have shared or separate borders.

border-collapse: separate;
border-collapse: collapse;


25.
Create a selector to target your td elements within your table 
body. Give them a width to fill the viewport, with a minimum and 
maximum of 4rem. 

This approach ensures that the width is fixed, whereas setting 
width specifically would allow the elements to shrink to the 
container.

tbody td {
    width: 100vw;

    min-width: 4rem;
    max-width: 4rem;
}

Diff btw width: 100% and width: 100vw? Use d above code block as 
practice. (U can include border to visually understand)

????????
The difference between using width: 100vw instead of width: 100% 
is that while 100% will make the element fit all the space 
available, the viewport width has a specific measure, in this 
case the width of the available screen, including the document 
margin.

If you set the style body { margin: 0 }, 100vw should behave the 
same as 100% (for an element that is a child to body).

Using vw as unit for everything in your website, including font 
sizes and heights, will make it so that the site is always 
displayed proportionally to the device's screen width regardless 
of it's resolution. This makes it super easy to ensure your 
website is displayed exactly the same in both workstation and 
mobile.


26.
width of the ENTIRE container(i.e 100% and not 100vw??), less 12rem.

tbody th {
    width: calc(100% - 12rem);
} 

Use tbody th/td/tr instead of th/td/tr alone.


27. [attribute="value"] selector:
The [attribute="value"] selector targets any element that has an 
attribute with a specific value. 


28. Difference btw tr[class="total"] and tr.total 
The key difference between tr[class="total"] and tr.total is that 
the first will select tr elements where the only class is total. 

The second will select tr elements where the class includes total.
Similar to this is tr[class~="total"]


29. :nth-of-type()
The :nth-of-type() pseudo-selector is used to target specific 
elements based on their order(position) among siblings of the 
same type. 

Use this pseudo-selector to target the third td element within 
your total table rows.

tr.total td:nth-of-type(3) {
    padding-right: 0.5rem;
}


30. y using size with color?
tr.data {
    background-image: linear-gradient(
        to bottom,
        #dfdfe2 1.845rem,
        #fff 1.845rem /* 29.52px */
    );
}

The linear-gradient() CSS function creates an image consisting of
a progressive transition between two or more colors along a 
straight line. Its result is an object of the <gradient> data type, 
which is a special kind of <image>.

Values:
<side-or-corner>
The position of the gradient line's starting point. 

If specified, it consists of the word to and up to two keywords: 
one indicates the horizontal side (left or right), and the other 
the vertical side (top or bottom). The order of the side keywords 
does not matter. If unspecified, it defaults to to bottom.

The values to top, to bottom, to left, and to right are equivalent 
to the angles 0deg, 180deg, 270deg, and 90deg, respectively. The 
other values are translated into an angle.

<angle>
The gradient line's angle of direction. 

A value of 0deg is equivalent to to top; increasing values rotate 
clockwise from there.


<linear-color-stop>
A color-stop's <color> value, followed by one or two optional stop 
positions, (each being either a <percentage> or a <length> along the 
gradient's axis).

<color-hint>
An interpolation hint defining how the gradient progresses between 
adjacent color stops. The length defines at which point between two 
color stops the gradient color should reach the midpoint of the color 
transition. 

If omitted, the midpoint of the color transition is the midpoint 
between two color stops.


31. Diff btw text-align and text-align-last?
text-align:
The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of the 
inline-level content inside a block element or table-cell box. 
This means it works like vertical-align but in the horizontal 
direction.

text-align-last:
The text-align-last CSS property sets how the last line of a block 
or a line, right before a forced line break, is aligned.

32. Calculating width:
There r 3 td of a width of 4rem mking 12rem in total. 
This is the 12rem minus from the 100% width of tbody th selector. 
tbody td {
    width: 100vw;

    min-width: 4rem;
    max-width: 4rem;
}

tbody th {
    width: calc(100% - 12rem);
}


33. Impact of linear-gradient: Use this
background-image: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    #dfdfe2 1.845rem,
    #fff 1.845rem
);


34. double:
border: 4px double #000;

For this to be visible, u need a border size greater than 2px;




*****************************************
Intermediate CSS: Positioning

1. universal selector: *


2. box-sizing:
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

This ensures elements include padding and border in their 
specified width and height.


3. CSS positioning:
CSS positioning lets you set how you want an element to be 
positioned in the browser. It has a position property you can 
set to static, absolute, relative, sticky or fixed.

Once you set the position property of the element, you can move 
the element around by setting a pixel or a percentage value for 
one or more of the top, right, left, or bottom properties.

static is the default positioning for all elements. If you assign 
it to an element, you won't be able to move it around with top, 
right, left, or bottom.


4. relative position: 
When you use the relative value, the element is still positioned 
according to the normal flow of the document, but the top, left, 
bottom, and right values become active.


5. absolute position: 
When you use the absolute 
value for your position property, the element is taken out of the 
normal flow of the document, and then its position is determined 
by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.


6. fixed position
fixed is a position property value that lets you make an element 
fixed to the page no matter where the user scrolls to on the page.


7. sticky positioning:
sticky positioning 
is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. It allows an 
element to stick to a specific position within its containing 
element or viewport, based on the scroll position.

Note: To see how sticky works, you have to place a couple of 
texts before and after d sticky element. If you scroll 
up after that, you'll see that the sticky element gets stuck 
to the top and remains there.


8. Using positioning and margin to center an elemt:
Set a value of 0 for the right, left, top, bottom properties, 
then set its margin property on all sides to auto. 


9. CSS Transform:
You can use CSS transform to rotate in a certain degree

The transform property allows you to modify the shape, position, 
and size of an element without changing the layout or affecting 
the surrounding elements. It has functions such as translate(), 
rotate(), scale(), skew(), and matrix().


10. z-index:
z-index is a property you can use to define the order of 
overlapping HTML elements. Any element with a higher z-index 
will always be positioned over an element with a lower z-index.


11. border radius:
To remove all the pointed edges of the ear, set border radius.


12. What does this mean?
border-color: black transparent transparent transparent;
border-radius: 190% / 190px 150px 0 0;


13.
Use a descendant selector to target the three div elements 
inside your .cat-whiskers-left element. Give it a width of 
40px, a height of 1px, and a background-color of #000.

.cat-whiskers-left div {
    width: 40px;
    height: 1px;
    background-color: #000;
}


14. border:
border-left:
border-right:
border-top:
border-bottom:


15.
border-top-left-radius:
border-top-right-radius:

border-bottom-left-radius:
border-bottom-right-radius:


16. ?????
border-color: black transparent transparent transparent;


17.
border-radius: 190% / 190px 150px 0 0;




*****************************************
Responsive Design:

1.
A class attribute can have multiple values. 

e.g:
<div class="key black--key"></div>


2.
Browsers can apply default margin and padding values to 
specific elements. To make sure your piano looks correct, 
you need to reset the box model.

html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}


3.
Now that you have reset the html box model, you need to pass 
that on to the elements within as well. To do this, you can 
set the box-sizing property to inherit, which will tell the 
targeted elements to use the same value as the parent element.


4. ::before & ::after
The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the 
first child of the selected element, while the ::after 
selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of 
the selected element.

*,
*::before,
*::after {
    box-sizing: inherit;
}


5. inherit value


6. float:


7.
.key.black--key::after selector. 
This will target the elements with the class(or classes??) key black--key


8.
set the content property to "". This will make the pseudo-elements 
empty.

The content property is used to set or override the content of the 
element. By default, the pseudo-elements created by the ::before 
and ::after pseudo-selectors are empty, and the elements will not 
be rendered to the page. Setting the content property to an empty 
string "" will ensure the element is rendered to the page while 
still being empty.


9. Relationship btw relative and absolute positioning
The img element needs its parent to have a position set as a point 
of reference. Set the position of the #piano selector to relative.


10. media query, @media:
The @media at-rule, also known as a media query, is used to 
conditionally apply CSS. 

Media queries are commonly used to 
apply CSS based on the viewport width using the max-width 
and min-width properties.

In the below example the padding is applied to the .card 
class when the viewport is 960px wide and below.

@media (max-width: 960px) {
    .card {
        padding: 2rem;
    }
}


11.
Logical operators can be used to construct more complex 
media queries. 

The and logical operator is used to query two media conditions.

For example, a media query that targets a display width 
between 500px and 1000px would be:

@media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 1000px){}

Add another @media rule to apply if the browser window is 
wider than 769px but smaller than 1199px.

@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1199px){}

City Skyline:
1. CSS variables:
CSS variables help you organize your styles and reuse them.


2.
Refresh every 30 seconds
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30" />


3. *
In CSS, you can target everything with an asterisk. 

* {
    border: 1px solid black;
}


4.
Also add a box-sizing of border-box to everything. This will 
make it so the border you added doesn't add any size to your 
elements.


5. Body:
You can see the body (it's the inner-most box on your page); 
the box around it is the html element. 

Make your body fill the whole viewport by giving it a height 
of 100vh. 

Remove the default margin from the body by setting the margin 
to 0. 

Finally, set the overflow property to hidden to hide any scroll 
bars that appear when something extends past the viewport.


6.
Give your .background-buildings element a width and height of 
100% to make it the full width and height of its parent, the 
body.

<body>
    <div class="background-buildings"></div>
</body>

body {
    height: 100vh;

    margin: 0;

    overflow: hidden;
}

.background-buildings {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}


7.
Variable declarations begin with two dashes (-) and are given 
a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value;. 

8.
To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var 
in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). Whatever value 
you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you 
use it on.

9.
Change the value of your variable from #999 to #aa80ff and you 
can see how it gets applied everywhere you used the variable. 

This is the main advantage of using variables, being able to 
quickly change many values in your stylesheet by just changing 
the value of a variable.


10. Height and Width:
Height and width starts from top and left respectively.


11.
The buildings are too spaced out. Squeeze them together 
by adding two empty div elements to the top of the 
.background-buildings element, two more at the bottom 
of it, and one more in between .bb3 and .bb4. These will 
be added as evenly-spaced elements across the container, 
effectively moving the buildings closer to the center.


12. Fallback value:
You can add a fallback value to a 
variable by putting it as the second value of where you 
use the variable like this: var(--variable-name, 
fallback-value). The property will use the fallback 
value when there's a problem with the variable. 

.bb1 {
    width: 10%;
    height: 70%;

    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;

    --building-color1: #999;
    --building-color2: #66cc99;
    --building-color3: #cc6699;
}

.bb2 {
    width: 10%;
    height: 50%;

    background-color: var(--building-color2, green);
}

.bb3 {
    width: 10%;
    height: 55%;

    background-color: var(--building-color3, pink);
}


13. :root selector()
That didn't work(d reason u added fallback value), 
because the variables you declared in 
.bb1 do not cascade to the .bb2 and .bb3 sibling elements. 

That's just how CSS works. Because of this, variables are 
often declared in the :root selector. This is the highest 
level selector in CSS; putting your variables there will 
make them usable everywhere. 


14. What position: relative; does?
Move the position of .fb4 relative to where it is now by 
adding a position of relative and left of 10% to it.


15. Gradients:
Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors 
across the distance of an element. They are applied to 
the background property and the syntax looks like this:

gradient-type (
    color1,
    color2
);

In the example, color1 is solid at the top, color2 is solid 
at the bottom, and in between it transitions evenly from one 
to the next. 

Gradients can use as many colors as you want like this:

gradient-type(
    color1,
    color2,
    color3
);

You can specify where you want a gradient transition to 
complete by adding it to the color like this:

gradient-type(
    color1,
    color2 20%,
    color3
);

Here, it will transition from color1 to color2 between 0% and 
20% of the element and then transition to color3 for the rest.
 
Gradient transitions often gradually change from one color to 
another. You can make the change a solid line like this:

linear-gradient(
    var(--first-color) 0%,
    var(--first-color) 40%,
    var(--second-color) 40%,
    var(--second-color) 80%
);

Add a linear-gradient to .bb2b that uses --building-color2 from 
0% to 6% and --window-color2 from 6% to 9%.

.bb2b {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;

    background: linear-gradient(
        var(--building-color2),
        var(--building-color2) 6%, 
        var(--window-color2) 6%, 
        var(--window-color2) 9%
    );
}


16. repeating-linear-gradient:
Change the gradient type from linear-gradient to 
repeating-linear-gradient for this section. This will make 
the four colors of your gradient repeat until it gets to 
the bottom of the element; giving you some stripes, and 
saving you from having to add a bunch of elements to create 
them.

.fb1c {
    width: 100%;
    height: 80%;

    background: repeating-linear-gradient(
            90deg,
            var(--building-color4),
            var(--building-color4) 10%,
            transparent 10%,
            transparent 15%
        ),

        repeating-linear-gradient(
            var(--building-color4),
            var(--building-color4) 10%,
            var(--window-color4) 10%,
            var(--window-color4) 90%
        );
}


17.
Next, change the two #999 of .bb2a to transparent. This will 
make the left and right borders invisible.


18. Gradient direction:
So far, all the gradients you created have gone from top 
to bottom, that's the default direction. You can specify 
another direction by adding it before your colors like 
this:

gradient-type(
    direction,
    color1,
    color2
);


19.
In this case, the first two colors will 
default to 0% and 7.5% because it starts at 0%, and 7.5% 
is half of the 15%.

.bb3 {
    width: 10%;
    height: 55%;
    background-color: var(--building-color3);

    background: repeating-linear-gradient(
        90deg, 
        var(--building-color3), 
        var(--building-color3), 
        var(--window-color3) 15%
    );
}


20.
When you increase the size of the left and right borders, the 
border on the bottom will expand to be the width of the combined
left and right border widths. 


21. media query
A media query can be used to change styles based on certain 
conditions, and they look like this:

@media (condition) {

}  


22. closest-corner circle:

    background: radial-gradient(
        closest-corner circle at 15% 15%,
        #ffcf33,
        #ffcf33 20%,
        #ffff66 21%,
        #bbeeff 100%
    );
