/*
ASK WHY?????????????????????????

Ths learnt:
1. Wn using flex to center a container, no need to give the 
parent container a width.

2. To center an item horizontally in a container:
- when main-axis is in horizontal direction i.e. flex-direction: 
row; use justify-content: center; 
- when main-axis in vertical i.e. flex-direction: column;
use align-items: center; 

These will centre the item(s) within the parent container.


3. If u think width: 100%; does nt work on a box/elemt, increase
it more than 100% and see the effect. Same for any other features.

width: 100%; 
It means d child elemt shd occupy d whole width of d parent elemt. 
It means be as big as the parent element i.e you want the child 
element to be as big as its parent but nt bigger than d parent.

The consequence is that if you have set margins and paddings on the 
parent element (and box-sizing is not set to border-box), the element 
will overflow, which is something you don’t necessarily want.

width: auto;
It means use the available space i.e margins and paddings will be 
respected, and the element will not overflow its parent.
The browser will calculate and select a width for the specified 
element.

Impt of width/height:
Width:
The width CSS property sets an element's width. By default, it sets 
the width of the content area, but if box-sizing is set to border-box, 
it sets the width of the border area.
width: px, rem, em, %, auto

The specified value of width applies to the content area so long as its 
value remains within the values defined by min-width and max-width.

If the value for width is less than the value for min-width, then 
min-width overrides width.

If the value for width is greater than the value for max-width, then 
max-width overrides width.


Height:
The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By default, 
the property defines the height of the content area. If box-sizing is 
set to border-box, however, it instead determines the height of the 
border area.
height: px, rem, em, %, auto

N.B: The min-height and max-height properties override height.

height: auto; 
The browser will calculate and select a height for the specified 
element.


4. U can use width ppty twice in a selector by using min/max-width 
and width.


5. A btn can have: 
background: transparent; 
and 
border: none;

The background shorthand CSS property sets all background style 
properties at once, such as: color, image, origin and size, or 
repeat method. Component properties not set in the background 
shorthand property value declaration are set to their default 
values.

transparent = not visible.


6. Impt of box-sizing:
The box-sizing CSS property sets how the "total" width and height 
of an element is calculated.

It applies to all elements that accept width or height.

.box {
    box-sizing: border-box;

    width: 100%;
    border: solid #5B6DCD 10px;
    padding: 5px;
}

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing    


7. In case you needed to use borders, use it for most impt containers.
8. Use ROYGBIV for your border colors.

9. Picture row(inline-direction) and column(block-direction) 
directions.

10. Learn to un(comment) out border(s).

11. Know more abt actual width by calculating width and padding.
N.B: Padding is a delicate th dt can affect width and height 
either +vely or -vely.

12. Understand perfectly your website structure (HTML layout).
How d elements r arranged and related.
How each division/section is placed.
How many components does each div/section has? 

13. min-width: 75px means width will be 75px and above and not
less.

14. max-width: 700px means width will be 700px and below and 
not higher.

15. Inline display
display: inline means: display d elemts side by side in a 
horizontal line.

The element generates one or more inline boxes that do not generate 
line breaks before or after themselves. In normal flow, the next 
element will be on the same line if there is space.


16. flex-wrap: nowrap/wrap/wrap-reverse;
The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one 
line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets 
the direction that lines are stacked.


17. box-shadow: none;
The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. 
You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described 
by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and 
color.

box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px red;
box-shadow: inset 5em 1em gold;

The box-shadow property enables you to cast a drop shadow from the frame of 
almost any element. If a border-radius is specified on the element with a 
box shadow, the box shadow takes on the same rounded corners.

Box-shadow generator is an interactive tool allowing you to generate a 
box-shadow.


18. white-space: pre-wrap;
The white-space CSS property sets how white space inside an element 
is handled.

White-space property specifies two things:
Whether and how white space is collapsed.
Whether and how lines wrap.

Note: To make words break within themselves, use overflow-wrap, 
word-break, or hyphens instead.

overflow-wrap
The overflow-wrap CSS property applies to text, setting whether the 
browser should insert line breaks within an otherwise unbreakable 
string to prevent text from overflowing its line box.

The property was originally a nonstandard and unprefixed Microsoft
extension called word-wrap, and was implemented by most browsers 
with the same name. It has since been renamed to overflow-wrap, 
with word-wrap being an alias.


19. opacity: 0.6;
The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the 
degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite 
of transparency.

0:	The element is fully transparent (that is, invisible).
1 (default value):	The element is fully opaque (visually solid/visible).


20. position: relative/absolute.
The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location 
of positioned elements.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position


Static:
This is d default positioning for HTML elements, where they follow the 
normal flow of the document based on the HTML structure.

The element is positioned according to the Normal Flow of the document. 
The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. 
This is the default value.


Relative:
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, 
and then offset relative to ITSELF based on the values of top, right, 
bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other 
elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is 
the same as if position were static.

The element is positioned relative to its original position.
Surrounding elements won't be affected, but there will be space
where the element would have been in the static (original) position.

This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index 
is not auto. 


Absolute:
The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space 
is created for the element in the page layout. The element is 
positioned relative to its closest POSTITIONED ANCESTOR (if any e.g 
a relatively positioned container) or to the initial containing block. 
Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, 
and left.

This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index 
is not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not 
collapse with other margins.


Fixed:
The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space 
is created for the element in the page layout. The element is 
positioned relative to its initial containing block, which is the 
VIEWPORT in the case of visual media. 
Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, 
bottom, and left.

Elements r positioned relative to the viewport and remain fixed 
even when the page is scrolled. There will be no space where 
the element would have been in the static position.


Sticky:
The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the 
document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling 
ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), 
including table-related elements, based on the values of top, 
right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the 
position of any other elements.

This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a 
sticky element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a 
"scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, 
auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest 
actually scrolling ancestor.

Elemts r positioned based on the user's scroll position. It 
behaves like a relative elemt until the user scrolls to a 
certain position, after wc it becomes fixed relative to its 
containing elemt or the viewport.


21. CSS is all about boxes all along.

22. line-height: The line-height CSS property sets the height 
of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between 
lines of text. 


23. :focus
The :focus CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a 
form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered 
when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with 
the keyboard's Tab key.

Note: This pseudo-class applies only to the focused element 
itself. Use :focus-within if you want to select an element 
that contains a focused element.


24. visibility: visible/hidden/collapse;
The visibility CSS property shows or hides an element without 
changing the layout of a document. The property can also hide 
rows or columns in a <table>.

To both hide an element and remove it from the document layout, 
set the display property to none instead of using visibility.


25. img, span, links r e.gs of inline elemets. 
Inline elemts do nt have both height and width properties.

inline-block elemt has both the inline and block display ppties. 
It has both height and width properties.

inline-flex: is similar to display: flex; but the container on 
wc display: inline-flex; is applied behaves like an inline elemt.

grid: by having grid layouts, you av precise ctrl over both rows 
and columns.

inline-grid: is similar to display: grid; but the container on wc 
display: inline-grid; is applied behaves like an inline elemt.

display: none; 
d elemt will be completely invisible and take up no space within
 d documt.

display:inherit; 
d child elemt with d display inherit will inherit the display value 
from its parent elemt(eg. div) and act as a block-level elemt.

display: initial; 
sets d display ppty of an elemt to its initial value, wc is usu 
inline for most elemts.


26. media(min/max-width: px) {} for responsiveness.

27. ul/ol has an invisible default margin top and bottom of 16px.
28. ul/ol has an invisible default left padding of 40px.

29. Grp more than 2 selectors together if dy have common ppties.


30. block/column axis:
CSS grid layout is a two-dimensional layout method enabling the 
laying out of content in rows and columns. Therefore in any grid 
we have two axes. The block or column axis, and the inline or 
row axis.


31. The cross axis:
The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis. Therefore, if your 
flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis 
runs down the columns.
If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs 
along the rows.


32. The main axis
The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:
row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse

Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along the row 
in the inline direction.

If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the main axis runs 
perpendicularly/downward.


align-content/-items/-self:

33. align-content: start/end/center/space-btw/space-ard
The CSS align-content property sets the distribution of space 
between and around content items along a flexbox's CROSS axis, 
or a grid or block-level element's BLOCK axis of a container. 

It affects space in a container around the content items.

This property has no effect on single line flex containers 
(i.e. ones with flex-wrap: nowrap) but does affect flex
containers with flex-direction: column.


34. align-items: stretch/start/end/center. 
The default value is stretch. The CSS align-items property sets 
the align-self value on all DIRECT children as a group. 

In flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the cross
axis. 

In grid layout, it controls the alignment of items on the block 
axis within their grid areas.


35. align-self: stretch/start/end/center. 
The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's 
align-items value common to all d children elements and affect 
only d specified child elemt.

In flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.

In grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. 


justify-content/-items/-self:

36. justify-content: start/center/space-between/-around/-evenly.
The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes 
SPACE between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex 
container, and the inline axis of a grid container. 
It deals with d parent container.


37. justify-items: stretch/center/start/end
The CSS justify-items property defines the default JUSTIFY-SELF for 
all items of the box, giving them all a default way of justifying 
each box along the appropriate axis.

The effect of this property is dependent of the layout mode we 
are in: 
In block-level layouts, it aligns the items inside their 
individual containing block on the inline axis.

In flexbox layouts, this property is ignored.

In grid layouts, it aligns the items inside their grid areas on 
the inline axis 


38. justify-self: stretch/start/end/center
It deals with a single child elemt. The CSS justify-self property 
sets the way a box or an item is justified inside its alignment 
container along the appropriate axis.


39. row-gap:
The row-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between 
an element's rows. Rows r in horizontal directions. 

Rows egs:
======================= row
row-gap
======================= row
row-gap
======================= row
row-gap
======================= row


40. column-gap
The column-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between 
an element's columns. Columns r in vertical directions.

Initially a part of Multi-column Layout, the definition of column-gap 
has been broadened to include multiple layout methods. Now specified 
in CSS box alignment, it may be used in multi-column, flexible box, 
and grid layouts.

column egs:

column               column              column              column
####    column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####
####    column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####
####    column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####
####    column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####  column-gap    ####


41. display
The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a 
block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as 
flow layout, grid or flex.

Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer 
display types. The outer type sets an element's participation in 
flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children.

display: inline/inline-block/flex/grid


42. inner and outer display:
<display-outside>
These keywords specify the element's outer display type, which 
is essentially its role in flow layout i.e. participation in 
flow layout:

1. block:
The element generates a block box, generating line breaks both 
before and after the element when in the normal flow.

2. inline:
The element generates one or more inline boxes that do not 
generate line breaks before or after themselves. In normal 
flow, the next element will be on the same line if there 
is space.


43. <display-inside>
These keywords specify the element's inner display type, which 
defines the type of formatting context that its contents are 
laid out in (assuming it is a non-replaced element). It sets 
the layout of children wc can be for instance flex, grid etc.


44. fill:
The fill attribute has two different meanings (color and final 
state of animation). For shapes and text it's a presentation 
attribute that defines the color (or any SVG paint servers like 
gradients or patterns) used to paint the element; for animation 
it defines the final state of the animation.


45. border:
The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It 
sets the values of border-width, border-style, and border-color.

The border property may be specified using one, two, or three 
of the values listed above. The order of the values does not 
matter.


46. outline:
The outline CSS shorthand property sets most of the outline 
properties in a single declaration.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
outline-width, outline-style, outline-color.

The outline property may be specified using one, two, or three 
of the values listed above. The order of the values does not 
matter. As with all shorthand properties, any omitted sub-values 
will be set to their initial values.


47. padding and margin:
The padding CSS shorthand property sets the padding area on all 
four sides of an element at once. 

An element's padding area is the space between its content and 
its border.

The margin CSS shorthand property sets the margin area on all 
four sides of an element.
The margin area, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border 
area to include an empty area used to separate the element from 
its neighbors. 

Its dimensions are the margin box width and the margin box height.

Note: Padding creates extra space within an element. In contrast, 
margin creates extra space around an element.


48. z-index
The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element 
and its descendants or flex and grid items. 

Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a 
smaller one.

For a positioned box (that is, one with any position other than 
static), the z-index property specifies:
- The stack level of the box in the current stacking context.
- Whether the box establishes a local stacking context.

The z-index property is specified as either the keyword auto or 
an <integer>.

z-index: auto;
The box does not establish a new local stacking context. The stack 
level of the generated box in the current stacking context is 0.


49. :not()
The :not() CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match 
a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items from being 
selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.

The :not() pseudo-class requires a selector list, a comma-separated 
list of one or more selectors, as its argument. The list must not 
contain another negation selector or a pseudo-element, but any other 
simple, compound, and complex selectors are allowed.

.playlist li:not(:last-child) {
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--background-color);
}


50. buttons:
button styles: 
the background color, text color, the border style, the size.

button states: hover, focus, active.


51. CSS scrollbars styling
The CSS scrollbars styling module defines properties that you 
can use for visual styling of scrollbars. You can customize the 
width of the scrollbar as required. 

You can also customize the color of the scrollbar track, which 
is the background of the scrollbar, and the color of the scrollbar 
thumb, which is the draggable handle of the scrollbar.

.poem {
    overflow: scroll;
    scrollbar-width: thin;
    scrollbar-color: red orange;
}

Note: When customizing scrollbars, ensure that the thumb and 
track have enough contrast with the surrounding background. 
Also ensure that the scrollbar hit area is large enough for 
people who use touch input.


52. vertical-align: baseline, top, middle, bottom, sub, text-top.
The vertical-align CSS property sets vertical alignment of an 
inline, inline-block or table-cell box.

You can't use it to vertically align block-level elements.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align


53. place-content:
The place-content CSS shorthand property allows you to align content 
along both the block and inline directions at once in a relevant layout 
system such as Grid or Flexbox.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
align-content, justify-content

place-content: end space-between;
place-content: space-around start;
place-content: start space-evenly;
place-content: end center;
place-content: center end;


54. place-items:
The CSS place-items shorthand property allows you to align items 
along both the block and inline directions at once in a relevant 
layout system such as Grid or Flexbox. 

If the second value is not set, the first value is also used for 
it.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
align-items, justify-items.

place-items: center stretch;
place-items: center start;
place-items: start end;
place-items: end center;
place-items: center;


55. place-self:
The place-self CSS shorthand property allows you to align an 
individual item in both the block and inline directions at 
once in a relevant layout system such as Grid or Flexbox. 

If the second value is not present, the first value is also 
used for it.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
align-self, justify-self

place-self: center stretch;
place-self: center start;
place-self: start end;
place-self: end center;

57. flex-start:
It means the items are all aligned to the start of the main axis. 

While this may all seem a little confusing, the rule to remember is 
that unless you do something to change it, flex items lay themselves 
out in the direction that words are laid out in the language of your 
document along the inline, row axis. Start and flex-start will be 
where the beginning of a sentence of text would start.

If you change flex-direction to one of the reverse values, they will 
lay themselves out from the end axis and in the reverse order to the 
way words are written in the language of your document. Then, start 
and flex-start will change to the end of that axis — so to the 
location where your lines would wrap if working in rows, or at the 
end of your last paragraph of text in the block direction.


58. flex-end:
It means the items are all aligned to the end of the main axis. 
End and flex-end will be where the beginning of a sentence of 
text would end.

60. Types of alignment:
Positional alignment
Baseline alignment
Distributed alignment


Helpful Hints:
61. Border: 
Use border to chech the initial width and height of an elemt.


62. Padding:
It increases an elemt's width and height.

Every side of an elemt needs padding - it may only 
be applicable at d top & bottom in sm cases.

It can also be helpful in alignmt.


63. Width:
It smtimes affect alignmt.


64. Height and Width go hand in hand with space alignmt.


65. Border:
It can also influence d space available for alignmt.


66. Projects:
Don't recollect what you crammed from a project 
but apply experiene and crictical thinking. Don't
be quick to check soln.


67. CSS Values:
Parent:
    height: auto;

Inner Parent:
    height: 100%;

Child:
    height: 55px;


68. Margin
margin: auto; may be very helpful.

*****************************************

HTML FORM elemt:
1. <!DOCTYPE html>
The whole essence of this is for the browser to know what 
type of document it's reading.


2. vh unit
It stands for viewport height, and is equal to 1% of the height 
of the viewport. This makes it relative to the viewport height.

body {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
}


3. Body Default Margin
The body has a default margin of 8px, wc may result in a 
horizontal scroll bar in case the whole page is used.

Get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default 
margin added by some browsers to 0.

body {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;

    margin: 0;
}


4. form action and method:
As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after 
the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting 
https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org.

The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL 
specified in the action attribute. 

The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters 
(with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request 
body (with method="post").

<form
    action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org"
    method="POST"
>

</form>


5. Fieldset
The <fieldset> HTML element is used to group several controls as 
well as labels (<label>) within a web form.

<form action="#">

    <fieldset>
        <legend>Choose your favorite monster</legend>

        <input 
            type="radio" 
            id="kraken" 
            name="monster" 
            value="K" 
        />
        <label for="kraken">Kraken</label>
        
        <br />

        OR: 

        Both "for" attribute and id attribute are nt needed 
        wn d input elemt is inside the label.

        <label>
            Kraken 

            <input 
                type="radio" 
                name="monster" 
                value="K" 
            />
        </label>
        
        <br />

        <input 
            type="radio" 
            id="sasquatch" 
            name="monster" 
            value="S" 
        />
        <label for="sasquatch">Sasquatch</label>

    </fieldset>

</form>


6. legend tag
The <legend> HTML element represents a caption or brief explanation 
for the content of its parent <fieldset>.

<fieldset>
    <legend>Choose your favorite monster</legend>

    <input type="radio" id="kraken" name="monster" value="K" />
    <label for="kraken">Kraken</label>
    
    <br />

    <input type="radio" id="sasquatch" name="monster" value="S" />
    <label for="sasquatch">Sasquatch</label>
</fieldset>


7. rem unit
The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size 
of the <html> element.


8. label
The <label> HTML element represents a caption/brief explanation 
for an item in a user interface.

To explicitly associate a <label> element with an <input> element, 
you first need to add the id attribute to the <input> element. Next, 
you add the for attribute to the <label> element, where the value 
of for is the same as the id in the <input> element.

Alternatively, you can nest the <input> directly inside the <label>, 
in which case the for and id attributes are not needed because the 
association is implicit:

As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed 
side by side on the same line. 

<label>
    Do you like peas?
    <input type="checkbox" name="peas" />
</label>


9. Input's "type" attribute
Specifying the "type" attribute of an input elemt of a form 
element is important for the browser to know what kind of 
data it should expect. 
If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.

The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the 
domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if 
the site does not use HTTPS.

A type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest 
parent form element.

<form 
    action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" 
    method="POST"
>

    ..................
    ..................

    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

type attribute can be: 
text, 
number, 
submit, 
radio, 
checkbox, 
password, 
email, 
file, 
date, 
month, 
week, 
time, 
datetime-local, 
range


10. required attribute
The Boolean required attribute, if present, indicates that the 
user must specify a value for the input before the owning form 
can be submitted.

The required attribute is supported by text, search, url, tel, 
email, password, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, 
checkbox, radio, file, <input> types along with the <select> and 
<textarea> form control elements. If present on any of these input 
types and elements, the :required pseudo class will match. If the 
attribute is not included, the :optional pseudo class will match.


11. minlength attribute
The minlength attribute defines the minimum string length that the 
user can enter into an <input> or <textarea>. The attribute must 
have an integer value of 0 or higher.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of maxlength, 
otherwise the value will never be valid, as it is impossible to 
meet both criteria.

For example: minlength="8"
By adding minlength="8", the value must either be empty or eight 
characters or longer to be valid.


12. pattern attribute 
The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression 
which the input's value must match for the value to pass 
constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular 
expression, as used by the RegExp type.

The pattern attribute is an attribute of the text, tel, email, 
url, password, and search input types.

[a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more 
lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5 and set minlength to 8. 

N.B: Since minlength is set with the regular expression there 
is no need for minlength attribute again.


13. name attribute
With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to 
provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This 
attribute is used to identify the element in the form 
submission.

To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute 
values.

<fieldset>
    <label for="">
        <input type="radio" name="account-type" />
        Personal
    </label>

    <label for="">
        <input type="radio" name="account-type" />
        Business
    </label>
</fieldset>


14. checked attribute
<input> elements of type checkbox are rendered by default 
as boxes that are checked (ticked) when activated, like you 
might see in an official government paper form. The exact 
appearance depends upon the operating system configuration 
under which the browser is running. Generally this is a 
square but it may have rounded corners. A checkbox allows 
you to select single values for submission in a form.

Providing a bigger hit area for your checkboxes:
In the above examples, you may have noticed that you can 
toggle a checkbox by clicking on its associated <label> 
element as well as on the checkbox itself. This is a 
really useful feature of HTML form labels that makes it 
easier to click the option you want, especially on 
small-screen devices like smartphones.

Beyond accessibility, this is another good reason to 
properly set up <label> elements on your forms.


15.  min and max attributes
min: 
The min attribute defines the minimum value that is acceptable 
and valid for the input containing the attribute. If the value 
of the element is less than this, the element fails validation. 
This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max 
attribute.

It is valid for the input types including: date, month, week, 
time, datetime-local, number and range types, and the <meter> 
element.

max:
The max attribute defines the maximum value that is acceptable 
and valid for the input containing the attribute. If the value 
of the element is greater than this, the element fails validation. 
This value must be greater than or equal to the value of the min 
attribute. 

Valid for the numeric input types, including the date, month, 
week, time, datetime-local, number and range types, and both 
the <progress> and <meter> elements.


16. select elemt
Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. 
The select element is a container for a group of option elements, 
and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. 


17. option element
The <option> HTML element is used to define an item contained in 
a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, 
<option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of 
items in an HTML document.


18. option value
Each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, 
the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.

The content of this attribute represents the value to be submitted 
with the form, should this option be selected. If this attribute 
is omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option 
element.


19. selected attribute
You can include a selected attribute on an <option> element to 
make it selected by default when the page first loads.


<!-- The second value will be selected initially -->
<select name="choice">
    <option value="first">First Value</option>

    <option value="second" selected>Second Value</option>

    <option value="third">Third Value</option>
</select>


20. Textarea element
The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, 
but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive 
multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and 
columns.

To give textarea an initial size, you can add the rows and 
cols attributes.

<textarea 
    name="" 
    id="bio" 

    rows="3" 
    cols="30"
>
</textarea>


21. placeholder attribute
The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until 
the user starts typing.


22. Why this, using margin and text-align for the same purpose?

h1,
p {
    margin: 1em auto;
    text-align: center;
}


23. width:
form {
    min-width: 300px;

    width: 60vw;

    max-width: 500px;

    margin: 0 auto;
}

The actual width in this case is max-width: 500px.


24. last-of-type{}
The :last-of-type CSS pseudo-class represents the last element 
of its type among a group of sibling elements.

<p>This `p` is not selected.</p>

<p>This `p` is not selected either.</p>

<p>
    This `p` is last `p` element of its parent e.g. `body` selected by `p` type
    selector.
</p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="item">This `div` is not selected.</div>

    <div class="item">This `div` is not selected either.</div>

    <div class="item">
        This `div` is last `div` element of its parent `div` selected by `.container
        .item` class selector.
    </div>

    <p class="item">
        This `p` is last `p` element of its parent `div` selected by `.container
        .item` class selector.
    </p>
</div>

p:last-of-type {
    background: skyblue;
}

.container .item:last-of-type {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}


25. Input, Textarea and Select
Select all input, textarea, and select elements, and make them 
take up the full width of their parent elements.

input,
select,
textarea {
    width: 100%;
}


26. class attribute
This can be used to apply different styles to diffent elemt.

The case-sensitive class selector starts with a dot (.) 
character. It will select everything in the document with that 
class applied to it.

Target an element if it has more than one class applied:
You can apply multiple classes to an element and target them 
individually, or only select the element when all of the classes 
in the selector are present. This can be helpful when building 
up components that can be combined in different ways on your site.

E.g:
For the second fieldset, you want the input and label text to 
appear on the same line.

Start, by giving the input elements in the second fieldset a 
class of inline.


27. unset
The unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value 
if the property naturally inherits from its parent, and to its 
initial value if not. In other words, it behaves like the 
inherit keyword in the first case, when the property is an 
inherited property, and like the initial keyword in the second 
case, when the property is a non-inherited property.

That is, it can either be inherit if it has a parent or initial
if it doesn't. 

unset can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS 
shorthand property all.


28. attribute selector
input[name="password"]
The above selects input elements with a name attribute value 
of password.
