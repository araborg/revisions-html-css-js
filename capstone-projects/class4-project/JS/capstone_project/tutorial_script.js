/*
Here you'll build a cash register app that will 
return change to the customer based on the price 
of the item, the amount of cash provided by the 
customer, and the amount of cash in the cash 
drawer. You'll also need to show different 
messages to the user in different scenarios, 
such as when the customer provides too little 
cash or when the cash drawer doesn't have enough 
to issue the correct change.

In the script.js file, you have been provided with 
the price and cid variables. The price variable is 
the price of the item, and the cid variable is the 
cash-in-drawer, which is a 2D array listing the 
available currency in the cash drawer.

The other variable you will need to add is the cash 
variable, which is the amount of cash provided by 
the customer for the item, which is provided via an 
input element on the page.

If you'd like to test your application with different 
values for price and cid, make sure to declare them 
with the let keyword so they can be reassigned by 
our tests.

Your application should show different messages 
depending on the price of the item, the amount of 
cash provided by the customer, and the amount of 
cash in the drawer:

"Status: INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS": if cash-in-drawer 
is less than the change due, or if you cannot 
return the exact change.

"Status: CLOSED": if cash-in-drawer is equal to 
the change due.

"Status: OPEN": if cash-in-drawer is greater than 
the change due and you can return change, with the 
change due in coins and bills sorted in highest to 
lowest order.

Currency                Unit	        Amount
Penny	                $0.01           (PENNY)
Nickel	                $0.05           (NICKEL)
Dime	                $0.1            (DIME)
Quarter	                $0.25           (QUARTER)
Dollar	                $1              (ONE)
Five Dollars	        $5              (FIVE)
Ten Dollars	            $10             (TEN)
Twenty Dollars	        $20             (TWENTY)
One Hundred Dollars	    $100            (ONE HUNDRED)


Lesson 1:
You should have an input element with an id of 
"cash".

<body>
    <h1>Build a Cash Register</h1>

    <input id="cash" />

    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>


Lesson 2:
You should have a div, span or p element with an 
id of "change-due".

<body>
    <h1>Build a Cash Register</h1>

    <input id="cash" />

    <div id="change-due"></div>

    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>


Lesson 3:
You should have a button element with an id of 
"purchase-btn".

<body>
    <h1>Build a Cash Register</h1>

    <input id="cash" />

    <div id="change-due"></div>

    <button id="purchase-btn" type=button>Purchase</button>

    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>


Lesson 4:
When the value in the #cash element is less than 
price, an alert should appear with the text 
"Customer does not have enough money to purchase 
the item".

const cashEl = document.getElementById("cash");
const purchaseBtn = 
    document.getElementById("purchase-btn");
const changeDue = document.getElementById("change-due");
const cashDrawerDisplay = 
    document.getElementById("cash-drawer-display");

const cashRegister = () => {
    const cashInCents = Math.round(Number(cash.value) * 100);
    const priceInCents = Math.round(price * 100);

    if (cashInCents < priceInCents) {
        alert("Customer does not have enough money to purchase the item");

        cash.value = "";

        return;
    }
};

const checkResults = () => {
    if (!cash.value) {
        return;
    }

    cashRegister();
};


purchaseBtn.addEventListener("click", checkResults);

cash.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
    if (e.key === "Enter") {
        checkResults();
    }
});


Lesson 5:
When the value in the #cash element is equal to 
price, the value in the #change-due element should 
be "No change due - customer paid with exact cash".

const cashRegister = () => {
    const cashInCents = Math.round(Number(cash.value) * 100);
    const priceInCents = Math.round(price * 100);

    if (cashInCents < priceInCents) {
        alert("Customer does not have enough money to purchase the item");

        cash.value = "";

        return;
    }

    if (cashInCents === priceInCents) {
        changeDue.innerHTML =
            "<p> No change due - customer paid with exact cash </p>";

        cash.value = "";

        return;
    }
};


Lesson 6:
When price is 19.5, the value in the #cash element 
is 20, cid is 
    [
        ["PENNY", 1.01],
        ["NICKEL", 2.05],
        ["DIME", 3.1],
        ["QUARTER", 4.25],
        ["ONE", 90],
        ["FIVE", 55],
        ["TEN", 20],
        ["TWENTY", 60],
        ["ONE HUNDRED", 100]
    ],

and the #purchase-btn element is clicked, the value 
in the #change-due element should be 
"Status: OPEN QUARTER: $0.5".

const cashRegister = () => {
    const cashInCents = Math.round(Number(cash.value) * 100);
    const priceInCents = Math.round(price * 100);

    if (cashInCents < priceInCents) {
        alert("Customer does not have enough money to purchase the item");

        cash.value = "";

        return;
    }

    if (cashInCents === priceInCents) {
        changeDue.innerHTML =
            "<p> No change due - customer paid with exact cash </p>";

        cash.value = "";

        return;
    }

        // needed variables:
    let changeDue = cashInCents - priceInCents;
    const denominations = [10000, 2000, 1000, 500, 100, 25, 10, 5, 1];
    const result = { status: "OPEN", change: [] };

    const reversedCid = [...cid] // adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.
        .reverse()
        .map(([denominationName, amount]) => [
            denominationName,
            Math.round(amount * 100),
        ]);

    const totalCID = reversedCid.reduce(
        (prev, [_, amount]) => prev + amount,
        0
    ); // 33541

    if (totalCID < changeDue) {
        changeDueDisplay.innerHTML = "<p>Status: INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS</p>";

        return;
    }

    // e.g: totalCID = 33541 and changeDue = 33541
    if (totalCID === changeDue) {
        result.status = "CLOSED";
    }

};
