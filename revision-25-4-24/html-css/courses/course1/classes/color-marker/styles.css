/*
There two main color models: 
    - the additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices
    - the subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print.

rgb(): CSS rgb function 

margin: 10px auto;

- Pry colors: are colors that when combined create pure white.
red
blue
green

- Sec colors: are the colors produced by primary colors. 
yellow:  pure red and pure green
cyan: pure green and pure blue
magenta: pure blue and pure red

- Tertiary colors: are created by combining a primary with 
a nearby secondary color.
orange: pure red and set green to 127, rgb(255, 127, 0)

spring green: combine cyan with green, rgb(0, 255, 127)

violet: combine magenta with blue, rgb(127, 0, 255)

chartreuse green: red is at 127, and set green to the max value.
rgb(127, 255, 0)

azure: green is at 127 and blue is at the max value, rgb(0, 127, 255)

rose: which is sometimes called bright pink. blue is at 127 and red 
is at the max value. rgb(255, 0, 127)


- Complementary Colors
A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near 
each other, and different ones are further apart. 

Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are 
called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, 
they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors 
produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, 
and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention 
to certain content on the page.


Hexadecimal:
Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters 
from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, 
the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent 
blue. For example, #4B5320.

With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%.
So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is 
the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).

Lower the intensity of green by setting the green value of the 
hex color to 7F, #007F00.


hsl():
The HSL color model, (or hue, saturation, and lightness).

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for 
hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage 
from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green 
is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% 
for pure color. You must add the percent sign % to the saturation 
and lightness values.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, 
to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.
