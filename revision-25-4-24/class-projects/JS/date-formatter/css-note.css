Gap: 
The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps (also called gutters) 
between rows and columns. This property applies to multi-column, 
flex, and grid containers.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
column-gap
row-gap

The visible space between elements may differ from the provided gap 
value because margins, padding, and distributed alignment may increase 
the separation between elements beyond what is determined by gap.

margin: auto
auto:
The browser selects a suitable margin to use. For example, in certain 
cases this value can be used to center an element.

Horizontal centering
You can horizontally center an element within its parent by setting 
margin: 0 auto;.

A more common method to center an element horizontally is by setting 
display: flex; and justify-content: center; on a container, which 
centers its flex item children.

Why use 100% for font?
font-size: 100%;


6.
appearance: none;

The appearance CSS property is used to display UI elements with 
platform-specific styling, based on the operating system's theme.

Before standardization, this property allowed elements to be shown 
as widgets, such as buttons or check boxes. It was considered a 
misfeature and authors are encouraged to use only standard keywords 
now.

Note: If you wish to use this property on websites, you should 
test it very carefully. Although it is supported in most modern 
browsers, its implementation varies. In older browsers, even the 
keyword none does not have the same effect on all form elements 
across different browsers, and some do not support it at all. 
The differences are smaller in the newest browsers.

Values:
none
Hides certain features of widgets, such as arrow displayed in 
select element, indicating that list can be expanded.

auto
Acts as none on elements with no special styling.


7.
Transition:
The transition CSS property is a shorthand property for 
transition-property, 
transition-duration, 
transition-timing-function, 
transition-delay, and 
transition-behavior.

Transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element. 
Different states may be defined using pseudo-classes like :hover or :active or 
dynamically set using JavaScript.

transition:
  all 200ms,
  opacity 400ms;

In this case, all the properties that change as the element changes state will 
transition with a duration of 200ms except for opacity, which will take 400ms 
to transition.

Basic example
In this example, when the user hovers over the element, there is a one-second delay before the four-second font-size transition occurs.

HTML:
<a class="target">Hover over me</a>

CSS
We include two <time> values. In the transition shorthand, the first <time> value is the transition-duration. The second time value is the transition-delay. Both default to 0s if omitted.

CSS:
.target {
    font-size: 14px;
    transition: font-size 4s 1s;
}

.target:hover {
    font-size: 36px;
}
