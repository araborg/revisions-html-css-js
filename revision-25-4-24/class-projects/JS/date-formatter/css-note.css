Gap: 
The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps (also called gutters) 
between rows and columns. This property applies to multi-column, 
flex, and grid containers.

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:
column-gap
row-gap

The visible space between elements may differ from the provided gap 
value because margins, padding, and distributed alignment may increase 
the separation between elements beyond what is determined by gap.

margin: auto
auto:
The browser selects a suitable margin to use. For example, in certain 
cases this value can be used to center an element.

Horizontal centering
You can horizontally center an element within its parent by setting 
margin: 0 auto;.

A more common method to center an element horizontally is by setting 
display: flex; and justify-content: center; on a container, which 
centers its flex item children.
