Consistency doesn't gurantee that you will be successful
but not being consistent will guarantee that you won't 
reach success.
An easy productivity hack is instead of spending time getting 
in the mood to work just start working. Confront the work. 
People think they need perfect conditions to start when in 
reality starting is the perfect condition.

Thanks for showing UP.
